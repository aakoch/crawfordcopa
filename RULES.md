# New Rules

1. No spaces in filenames
2. HTML files must have the extension ".html"
2. No more use of the following tags
  - font
  - center
3. Paths that start with a slash "/" must have "src" as the prefix
4. Attributes must be lowercase
5. No attributes in the body tag. 
6. Replace "name" with "id" in your anchors. Ex: `<a name="1832A"></a>`
7. No more use of `&nbsp;` nor tables used for layout.
8. Fractions should be added using their appropriate HTML entity: &frac__; eg: 1/2 is &frac12;

I haven't decided on _if_ we are going to use a templating language. 
Some possibilities include Pug, Nunjucks, Handlebars, etc.
