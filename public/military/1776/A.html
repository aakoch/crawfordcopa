[&#182;] The subject of the above notice, was well known in this community; he resided in Meadville from 1795, until 1825, when he received the appointment of military storekeeper at West Point.&nbsp; His residence in this village, commenced with his appointment to the general agency of the Holland Land Company, for Western Pennsylvania, which trust he held ten years, he was afterwards twice elected to the State legislature, and received various other important appointment in the county. [&#182;] Major Alden was an officer of the Revolutionary army, he served as an aid to Gen. Green during part of the war, and being almost the last of that band of heroes who yet lingered with us, became before his decease, emphatically, a man of a former generation. [&#182;] He was a gentleman of a liberal education, and possessed a fund of information on almost all subjects, he was fitted for usefulness in life, and to communicate profit and enjoyment in social intercourse; in the later years of his life, the Bible was his chief study, in its sublime doctrines he had profussed his faith, by a public recognition of his duty to confess Christ, when he united with the Presbyterian Church of this place, before his departure for West Point.&#148;

[&#182;] The deceased came to this place at an early day, where she resided a greater part of her life.&nbsp; She was a woman of much intelligence, varied reading, and of true devotional feeling.&nbsp; She had for many years been a professor of religion; and was diligent in the care of the means of grace.&nbsp; She spent much time in prayer, and her constant daily companion was God&#146;s Word.&nbsp; She also took delight in reading the works of the old divines, of whom Baxter was a great favorite.
