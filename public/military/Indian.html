Co., 1912), p. 888:&nbsp; &#147;SIVERLING  The Siverlings descend from Christopher Siverling, a German who settled for a time in Northampton, Pennsylvania, then lived in Westmoreland county, where he married and had a family born.&nbsp; In 1797 he settled in Venango township, Crawford Countyy [<i>sic</i>], on a tract directly south of Venango village.&nbsp; Their first winter was one of hardship and peril, the dense forsets were filled with wild beasts, while two bushels of corn, a small quantity of beef and a few turnips, constituted their food supply.   But they safely passed all perils, and the hardy pioneer ended his days in peace and plenty.&nbsp; His sons were:&nbsp; Christer, John and Daniel, all well known respectable men.&#148;
