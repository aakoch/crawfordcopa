F. Y. ROYAL, farmer, P. O. Turnersville, was born February 10, 1822, in this township, and is a son of Peter and Mary (Yokes) Royal.&nbsp; His father came to this county in 1798, with his parents, who settled in West Shenango.&nbsp; Peter Royal was from New Jersey; his wife was from Virginia.&nbsp; Our subject remembers when the county was very new, and has heard
much from his grandparents of the privations of the early days.&nbsp; His advantages were few, compared to those of the present, yet he seems to have enjoyed life fully as well as those who live amid all modern improvements.&nbsp; His grandparents came into the woods, and began as pioneers that struggle with nature, and whose victories are represented in the beautifully developed farms now enjoyed by their descendants.&nbsp; Peter Royal was the father of
eight children who grew to maturity, and but two of whom now survive:&nbsp; Mrs. Saville Cole, and F. Y.&nbsp; Our subject was first married to Miss Rebecca Betts, by whom he had one child—Melvina—now Mrs. De Voss.&nbsp; By his second wife, Emily C. Pratt, he has one child—Mary C.—now Mrs. Norton.&nbsp; Mr. Royal occupies a part of 100 acres which were owned by his father; is one of the leading farmers of the township, and has been ten years Justice of the Peace; is also School Director.&nbsp; He and his family belong to the Methodist Episcopal Church.
