<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>*95</b></font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>SOUTH SHENANGO</i></b> was formed together with 
North and West Shenango in 1811.&nbsp; It lies upon the south border, 
near the south-west corner of the county, and contains 17,102 
square acres.&nbsp; West Shenango was taken off April 14, 1863.&nbsp; 
The surface is drained by small streams flowing south-west into 
Shenango Creek, which separates this from West Shenango 
township.&nbsp; The Erie & Pittsburgh R. R. passes through the 
western part, adjacent to Shenango Creek. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,042, all of whom were white, 
965, native and 77, foreign. 
<br>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, it contained eight 
schools and employed fourteen teachers.&nbsp; The number of 
scholars was 249; the average number attending school, 214; 
and the amount expended for school purposes $2,154.04.

<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1795, and, as far as our information extends, previous to the settlement of the township, the camp of <a name="3"></a>William Power, who was engaged in making surveys of tracts now embraced in 
South Shenango, was robbed by a band of Indians, on the 5th 
of June, and <a name="4"></a>James Thompson, who had charge of the camp 
at the time, was taken prisoner, but subsequently effected his 
escape.&nbsp; The locality where this event occurred was known to 
the settlers as the &#147; White Thorn Corner.&#148;
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlement of which we have information was made 
the following year, (1796) or about that time, by <a name="5"></a>Hugh Fletcher, 
a native of Ireland.&nbsp; <a name="6"></a>Robert McComahey and <a name="7"></a>James Davis, 
also from Ireland, and <a name="8"></a>M. Marshall, from Westmoreland county, 
came in 1797.&nbsp; McComahey came with knapsack and camp 
kettle upon his back and settled on the farm now owned by his 
son of the same name.&nbsp; Soon after his arrival he went to Westmoreland county and returned with cattle, sheep and horses, but 
his shirts and dishes were stolen by the Indians during his 
absence.&nbsp; He bought 200 acres, paying therefor one dollar per

died at the age of eighty.&nbsp; <a name="19"></a>John Gallagher, a native of Ireland, 
emigrated to this country in 1799.&nbsp; He landed at Baltimore, 
and after a short stay there he came to this township, on foot 
from Pittsburgh, and took up land on tract 810, now owned by 
his children, <a name="20"></a>Sarah and <a name="21"></a>John Gallagher, in 1800.&nbsp; He married 
his wife in Fayette county and brought her here in 1806.&nbsp; He 
died in 1832, aged 67 years.&nbsp; <a name="22"></a>Solomon Dowlhott, <a name="23"></a>John Nevins
