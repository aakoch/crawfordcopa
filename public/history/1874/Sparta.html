<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>SPARTA</i></b> was formed in 1830.&nbsp; It is the north-east corner township in the county, and contains 23,913 square acres.&nbsp; It is well watered by the east branch of Oil Creek, which passes through the central part, and the north-west branch of Spring Creek and Spaulding and Brittain runs, tributary to it.&nbsp; It has an important lumber manufacturing interest, its seven saw mills and three shingle mills having an aggregate capacity for cutting about 13,000.000 feet of lumber and 10,000,000 shingles per annum.&nbsp; The Oil Creek &amp; Allegheny Valley R.R. crosses the township along the valley of Oil Creek, and affords ample facilities for the transportation of the vast quantities of lumber manufactured here.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,131, of whom 1,088 were native, 43, foreign and all, except three,
white.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, the township contained <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>98</b>&gt;</font> eight schools and employed thirteen teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 249; the average number attending school, 212; and the amount expended for school purposes, $2,688.54.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Spartansburg" href="../../places/Spartansburg.html">S<font size="-1">PARTANSBURG</font></a>, (p.v.) situated on the east-branch of Oil Creek and the Oil Creek &amp; Allegheny Valley R. R., a little north-east of the center of the township, is a thriving village of about 600 inhabitants.&nbsp; It is rapidly improving, both in the number of buildings and inhabitants.&nbsp; It contains two churches, two hotels, fourteen stores of various kinds, two carriage shops, a woolen mill, steam tannery, saw and planing mill and a cabinet shop.&nbsp; The first store, (which is now occupied by <a name="34"></a>Blackmer &amp; Farley as a boot and shoe store,) was built in 1837, by <a name="35"></a>Andrew and <a name="36"></a>Aaron Akin, from whom the place was known as Akinsville, which name it retained until the establishment of the post office, when the present one was substituted.&nbsp; It was incorporated as a borough in 1856.&nbsp; Its population in 1870 was 457.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The settlement of this township was commenced at a comparatively recent date, by <a name="38"></a>Reuben and <a name="39"></a>Abraham Blakeslee, father and son, who came from Washington county, N. Y., to Meadville in 1817, and to Sparta, April 11th, 1818.&nbsp; They located on the place now occupied by Abraham, who was sixty-two years old Jan. 4, 1872.&nbsp; Reuben died July 20, 1848, aged sixty-two years, and his wife <a name="40"></a>Prudence, died Feb. 8, 1851, at the same age.&nbsp; Near the door of their residence stands an apple tree which is forty-five years old and measures seven and one-half feet in circumference.&nbsp; <a name="41"></a>David Blakeslee, who was born at New Haven, Conn., May 12, 1740, came in from Granville, N. Y., the same year, and settled upon a tract of 175 acres which he cleared and on which his son, <a name="42"></a>Jesse A., who was then sixteen years old, is still living.
