<blockquote><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>70</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>NORTH SHENANGO</i></b> was formed together with South 
and West Shenango in 1811.&nbsp; It lies upon the west border of 
the county, south of the center, and contains 15,865 square 
acres.&nbsp; It is watered by Shenango Creek and several small 
streams flowing into it, the principal of which is Bennett&#146;s Run, 
which drains the central portion, flowing north-west.&nbsp; Shenango Creek enters the township from Sadsbury, near the south-east corner, and flowing in a north-westerly direction through 
Pymatuning Swamp, which impinges on the north border, forms 
the major portion of the north boundary, when it deflects to the 
south-west, crossing the line in its course into Ohio a short 
distance, when it again enters the township and finally leaves 
it in the south-west corner.&nbsp; The surface is level, and the soil of 
good quality, producing excellent crops.&nbsp; That part of the 
township in the north, covered by swamps, is but little cleared, 
while the southern part is in a good state of cultivation.&nbsp; The 
<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>71</b>&gt;</font> 
inhabitants, though chiefly engaged in dairying and stock raising give some attention to lumbering. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Erie & Pittsburgh R. R. passes through the central part of the township. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 901, of whom 866 were native, 35, foreign, 898, white and three, colored. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1873, the township contained seven schools and employed fifteen teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 301; the average number attending school, 
189; and the amount expended for school purposes, $1,390.15. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Espyville"></a>E<font size="-1">SPYVILLE</font>, (p. o.) situated in the western part, about one mile from the E. & P. R. R., contains a church, store, school 
house, wagon shop, shoe shop, paint shop, three blacksmith 
shops, a saw mill and about twenty dwellings.&nbsp; It derives its 
name from <a name="1"></a>George Espy, an early settler there. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><a name="2"></a>D. &amp; <a name="3"></a>J. F. Patton</i>&#146;<i>s Steam Saw Mill</i>, located at Espyville station, gives employment to twelve persons and cuts about 
600,000 feet of lumber, 1,500,000 shingles and 500,000 lath per annum. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Stewartsville"></a>S<font size="-1">TEWARTSVILLE</font>, (North Shenango p. o.) is situated on Bennetts Run, in the eastern part of the township. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Indications that the country embraced within the limits of 
this township was occupied by a race of people versed in the 
arts of civilization, at a period long anterior to the advent of 
the present inhabitants, are found in the remains of fortifications and relics of an early period exhumed in their vicinity; but whether these evidences are referable to the operations of the 
French in this locality, or to a period anterior to their occupancy can at present only be conjectured.&nbsp; These forts, which are circular in form, are located on Shenango Creek, 
about one-fourth of a mile apart, and each covers an area of 
half an acre to an acre.&nbsp; The outlines of two of them are still 
discernable, the glacis being two to three feet high, and the 
rifle pits of similar depth.&nbsp; Upon these embankments large 
trees have grown, which give evidence of their great age, while 
within old gun barrels, fragments of human bones and other 
relics of an earlier age have been disclosed.&nbsp; <a name="4"></a>Andrew Linn, 
while opening a spring in the northern part of the township, 
disclosed a portion of a stone wall, which, though evidently a 
piece of masonry, does not sufficiently indicate its design. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The present settlement was commenced as early as 1798, in 
which year <a name="5"></a>David McKee and <a name="6"></a>Anthony Bennett, from Susquehanna county, located&#151;the former in the south-western part, near Espyville, and the latter in the northern part.&nbsp; McKee came with an ox team to Meadville and thence through the 
<font size="=1">&lt;page <b>72</b>&gt;</font> 
woods, guided by blazed trees to his place of settlement, where 
he arrived in the spring of the year.&nbsp; Bennett built the first 
saw and grist mills in the township, upon the stream which 
bears his name.&nbsp; The following year <a name="7"></a>Sidney Herriott and <a name="8"></a>Henry 
Bennett became settlers.&nbsp; Herriott was from New Jersey, though 
he had lived two years at Williamsport, Pa., and located in the 
northern part of the township.&nbsp; He came from Pittsburgh on 
foot.&nbsp; Bennett came from Northumberland county and settled 
a little east of the center.&nbsp; He came up French Creek by canoe 
to Meadville, and lived on the farm upon which he settled 
the remainder of his days.&nbsp; <a name="9"></a>Sam&#146;l Barackman settled in the northern part in April, 1800.&nbsp; He came from Susquehanna county the 
previous year, but remained during the winter in Greenwood.&nbsp; He 
had to cut a road through the woods from Hartstown in order to 
reach his destination with his ox team.&nbsp; When he first came he 
was obliged to go to Sugar Creek, a distance of about thirty 
miles, to get his grinding done.&nbsp; The journey there and back 
usually occupied two days, sometimes much longer.&nbsp; Several 
years later a grist mill was built at Colts Station, in the southern part of Conneaut township, and thither, across the swamp, which was made passable with brush and poles, he carried upon 
his back one and one-half to two bushels of grain.&nbsp; Salt cost 
$15 per barrel, and could be obtained no nearer than Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Pork was worth two shillings per pound, and potatoes two dollars per bushel.&nbsp; He built a log house on the farm he 
settled and on which he lived till his death.&nbsp; He erected the 
first framed building&#151;a barn&#151;built in the township, about the 
year 1818.&nbsp; <a name="10"></a>Hannah Linn came with her family in May of the 
same year, (1800) and settled in the western part, where they 
cleared a farm, on which she resided till her death, and which 
is now owned by the family.&nbsp; They came from New Jersey via 
Pittsburgh with a four horse team, and cut their road through 
the woods from that city.&nbsp; During the first winter of their residence here, blankets were used as a substitute for doors, and would seem to have afforded meager security against the wild 
beasts which made the night hideous with their frightful 
screams.&nbsp; <a name="11"></a>Wm. Reed settled with his family in the south-western part about the same year.&nbsp; They came from the Susquehanna and proceeded as far as Franklin in a canoe, his wife following 
along the river upon horseback and driving two cows before.&nbsp; When they had got within fifteen miles of Franklin, their supply of provisions became exhausted, and Mr. Reed proceeded on 
foot to procure a new supply.&nbsp; They stopped at first in the eastern part of the township, but subsequently removed to the vicinity of a spring discovered by <a name="12"></a>Mrs. Reed while lost in the 
woods, she, in company with <a name="13"></a>Mrs. Bennett, having started out 
<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>73</b>&gt;</font> 
with their husbands&#146; dinners.&nbsp; It is related by <a name="14"></a>Isaiah Collins 
that these two women, having lost their way rambled through 
the woods and at night took refuge in small trees up which 
they climbed.&nbsp; During the night an animal, which they supposed to be a panther, made its appearance, and Mrs. Reed urged her companion to appease the hungry beast and secure 
themselves from harm by the sacrifice of the babe she had with 
her; but the thought so repugnant to a mother&#146;s sensibilities 
was too horrifying to be obscured by that of personal danger and 
was promptly rejected.&nbsp; In the morning their fears of immediate danger were removed by the retreat of the animal.&nbsp; They descended and after some time their attention was attracted by 
the sound of chopping, toward which they turned their steps, 
and soon were gratified with the sight of two men, engaged in 
digging out a trough, by whom they were piloted to their 
homes, where they learned that the neighborhood was aroused 
and searching for them.&nbsp; <a name="15"></a>James Reed, son of <a name="16"></a>Wm., is believed 
to have been the first child born in the township. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="17"></a>Isaac W., <a name="18"></a>Henry and <a name="19"></a>Elijah Collins, brothers, came from Mifflin county, with a four horse team, and settled, the former 
at Espyville, and the latter two near the central part, in 1801.&nbsp; 
Isaac was a soldier in the war of 1812, and resided on the farm 
he cleared till his death.&nbsp; Henry and Elijah settled on one farm, 
but the former lived only three or four years in his new home.&nbsp; 
The Espys were among the first settlers.&nbsp; <a name="20"></a>Geo. Espy came from 
Redstone, Bedford county, about 1802, and located at Espyville, 
to which place he gave his name.&nbsp; <a name="21"></a>Patterson Espy probably 
kept the first store, a little south of this place.&nbsp; <a name="22"></a>Patrick Davis, 
a native of Ireland, came from Lancaster county, and settled in 
the eastern part of the township about 1803.&nbsp; He cleared a 
farm and lived on it the remainder of his days.&nbsp; <a name="23"></a>James Pollock 
came from Westmoreland county in 1803 or &#146;4, and settled in the 
north-western corner of the township where he resided till his death in 1815. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first school house was built at Espyville, but the first 
school is believed to have been taught by <a name="24"></a>Joseph Wright, in a 
log (private) house in the central part of the township, at what is known as Elliotts Corners. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1"><i>Center Chapel</i>, (M. E.) at Elliott&#146;s Corners, was organized with sixteen members, in 1825, by <a name="25"></a>Revs. Chas. Elliott, the presiding Elder, and <a name="26"></a>Thomas Carr, the first pastor.&nbsp; The first edifice was erected in 1827 or &#146;8, and the 
present one, which will seat 250 persons, in 1850, at a cost of $800.&nbsp; The 
Society consists of forty-eight members, is ministered to by <a name="27"></a>Rev. Ira D&nbsp; 
Darling, our informant, and its property is valued at about &#147;$200.&#148; (?)</font> 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1"><i>Espyville M. E. Church</i>, at Espyville, was organized with seven 
members in 1831, probably by <a name="28"></a>Rev. Wm. Thorn, who is believed to have 
been the first pastor.&nbsp; The first house of worship was erected about 1832, 
<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>74</b>&gt;</font> 
and the present one, which will seat about 400 persons, in 1870, at a cost 
of $6,000.&nbsp; There are sixty members, who are under the pastoral care of 
<a name="29"></a>Rev. Ira D. Darling, our informant.&nbsp; The Church property is valued at $7,500.</font>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1"><i>North Shenango United Presbyterian Church</i> was organized in 1849, by <a name="30"></a>Rev. H. H. Thompson.&nbsp; Their house of worship, which will seat 250 persons, 
was erected in 1846.&nbsp; The first pastor was <a name="31"></a>Rev. W. Dalzell; the present 
one is <a name="32"></a>Rev. H. H. Hervey, our informant.&nbsp; The Society numbers one hundred.</font>
