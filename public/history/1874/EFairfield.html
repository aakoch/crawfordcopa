<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>*51</b></font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>EAST FAIRFIELD</i></b> was formed from Fairfield in
1869.&nbsp; It is an interior township, lying south of the center of the
county and on the east branch of French Creek, by which it is
separated from Fairfield.&nbsp; It covers an area of 7,734 square
acres.&nbsp; The surface is rolling and drained by French Creek and
its tributaries, the principal of which is Sugar Creek, which
crosses the north-east corner of the township.&nbsp; The soil is very
productive and is chiefly devoted to grain culture, though dairying
is beginning to engage the attention of the people.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The old French Creek Canal crosses the north-west corner of
the township, and the Franklin branch of the Atlantic & Great
Western R. R., passes through the township along the valley of
French Creek, crossing the canal within the limits of the township.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 741, all of whom
were white, 661 native and 80, foreign.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, it contained five schools
and employed ten teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 220;
the average number attending school, 158; and the amount
expended for school purposes, $877.28.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Cochranton"></a><a href="../../places/Cochranton.html">C<font size="-1">OCHRANTON</font></a> (p. v.) is pleasantly situated on French Creek,
in the south angle of the township, and is the principal station
on the Franklin branch of the A. & G. W. R. R., by which it
is distant eleven miles south of Meadville.&nbsp; It is surrounded by
a rich agricultural country, and is the depot for a vast amount
of farm produce which seeks a market by the railroad.&nbsp; From
the country in its immediate vicinity large quantities of ties
are brought in for use on the A. & G. W. R. R.&nbsp; It contains
three churches, (M. E., Presbyterian and United Presbyterian,)
three hotels, twelve stores, a tannery, grist mill, oil barrel manufactory,
three blacksmith shops, a shoe shop and had in 1870
a population of 459.&nbsp; It was organized as a borough April 16,
1855, and derives its name from <a name="1"></a>Joseph and <a name="2"></a>James Cochran,
who were early settlers, bought large tracts of land and inaugurated
the first substantial improvements in this locality.&nbsp; The
present population is about 475.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Shaws"></a>S<font size="-1">HAWS</font> L<font size="-1">ANDING</font> (p. o.) is situated on French Creek, five <font size="-1"><b>*52</b></font>
miles above Cochranton, and on the Franklin branch of the
A. & G. W. R. R.&nbsp; It derives its name from <a name="3"></a>Peter Shaw, an old
settler, and contains a hotel, store and oil refinery.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Stitzerville"></a>S<font size="-1">TITZERVILLE</font> (Pettis p. o.) is located in the eastern part of the township and contains a store, saw mill and cider mill.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlement, so far as we have been able to learn, was
made by <a name="4"></a>Henry Marley, who came from Ireland to New York in
1790, and to this township in June, 1793.&nbsp; He built the first
house erected in the township.&nbsp; It was constructed of logs and
was located on the Creek road.&nbsp; His son <a name="5"></a>James J. Marley, our
informant, was born in the township in 1804 and still resides
here.&nbsp; <a name="6"></a>Wm. Dean, from Westmoreland county, and <a name="7"></a>John Wolford
from Somerset county, came here in 1794.&nbsp; Dean came on
horseback from Pittsburgh and arrived in April of that year.
<a name="8"></a>Thos. Powell, from Allegheny county, settled here in 1796;
Peter Shaw, from the same county, in April, 1797; and <a name="9"></a>John
Adams, from Susquehanna county, in 1798.&nbsp; Adams located at
Cochranton and commenced that village by the erection of a
saw mill, in 1807.&nbsp; Four years from the latter settlement&#151;in
1802&#151;the first school house was built on the Creek road, on
the place settled by <a name="10"></a>Andrew Gibson.&nbsp; In 1803, <a name="11"></a>Robert Harvey
came here from Cumberland county.&nbsp; <a name="12"></a>Walter Evans, from Lancaster
county, settled in Meadville in 1810, and removed thence
to this township.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">The <i>M. E. Church</i>, at Cochranton, was organized with twelve members, in January, 1839, by <a name="13"></a>Rev. Wm. Patterson, the first pastor.&nbsp; The church
edifice was erected in 1843 and remodeled in 1870.&nbsp; Its original cost was
$900.&nbsp; It will seat about 400 persons.&nbsp; There are seventy-five members,
who are under the pastoral care of <a name="14"></a>Rev. John Abbott.&nbsp; The Church property
is valued at $2500.&#151;[<i>Information furnished by Mr. <a name="15"></a>E. P. Slocum.</i>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>The Presbyterian Church</i>, at Cochranton, was organized in 1870, by <a name="16"></a>Rev. David Patton, the first pastor.&nbsp; Their house of worship, which will seat
400 persons, was erected in 1850, at a cost of $1,500, one-half the present
value of Church property.&nbsp; The Society is without a pastor, the pulpit
being filled by supplies.&#151;[<i>Information furnished by Mr. <a name="17"></a>John Bell.</i>
