<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Spring township was formed from Beaver in 1830.&nbsp; It borders upon Erie county, and contains 26,102 square acres.&nbsp; The soil is very fertile, and seems especially adapted to dairying purposes.&nbsp; It is well watered by Conneaut and Cussewago creeks, the latter emptying into French creek at Meadville.&nbsp; The first settlement in the township was made by <a name="225"></a>Alexander Power, who, accompanied by his brother, located on the present site of Conneautville in 1795, taking up a tract of 800 acres.&nbsp; He built the first grist mill in the township, and the first saw mill west of French creek.&nbsp; Among the other early settlers in this locality, prior to 1796, were <a name="226"></a>Justus Ross, <a name="227"></a>Rob't Temple, <a name="228"></a>Isaac
Thayer and <a name="229"></a>James Patterson.&nbsp; Following in their footsteps were <a name="230"></a>John Foster, <a name="231"></a>Robert Nelson, <a name="232"></a>Samuel Thompson, <a name="233"></a>Rob't McCoy and <a name="234"></a>Thomas Foster.&nbsp; The first white child born in this vicinity, of which record has been made, was <a name="235"></a>William R. McCoy in 1803.&nbsp; The first church edifice built in the township was erected about a mile north of Conneautville, by the Presbyterians, and <a name="236"></a>John Boyd was its first pastor.&nbsp; The first pedagogue of whom mention is made was <a name="237"></a>Josiah Brooks, of whom many anecdotes are related to this day.&nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,522.&nbsp; During the year ending June 1, 1874, the township contained 22 schools.&nbsp; The total number of pupils attending school last year was 335, with an average attendance of 253.&nbsp; The tax levied for school purposes in 1878 was $1,905.12.
