<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HIS</font> is an interior township, and was formed in 1847, and derives its name from the forest of pine trees within its limits.&nbsp; It contains 6,369 square acres, a large area being covered by the Pymatuming [<i>sic</i>; Pymatuning] swamp.&nbsp; Agriculture and lumbering form the chief pursuits of the people, who in 1870 numbered 777.
