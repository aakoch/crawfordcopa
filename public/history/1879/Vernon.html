<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vernon lies on the west bank of French Creek and is bounded on the west by Summit and Sadsbury
townships.&nbsp; It was formed from Fairfield in 1830, and possesses an area of 16,194 acres.&nbsp; The soil is very fertile and in an excellent state of cultivation.&nbsp; The first settlers locating in this vicinity were <a name="281"></a>David Mead and <a name="282"></a>Cornelius VanHorn.&nbsp; The former took up a tract of land about a mile north-west of the present site of Meadville, in the month of May, 1788; and the latter, finding a deserted Indian cabin farther south, moved into it.&nbsp; Among other early settlers were <a name="283"></a>John Mead, <a name="284"></a>John Fredebaugh, <a name="285"></a>Thomas Hay and <a name="286"></a>William Gregg.&nbsp; The latter was captured by the Indians while working in a cornfield, in the summer of 1791, and was afterwards killed and scalped.&nbsp; About 1797 came <a name="287"></a>James Davis, <a name="288"></a>James Birchfield and <a name="289"></a>Theo.dore Scowden; and soon afterwards <a name="290"></a>Gabriel Davis and one
<a name="291"></a>Affentranger, who built the first tavern in the township.&nbsp; About 1817 <a name="292"></a>H. J. Huidekoper built a saw and grist mill on the west bank of French Creek, near the mouth of the Cussewago.&nbsp; <a name="293"></a>William Kerr, at an early day built a tavern and store across the creek from Meadville, and gave his name to the village which sprang up in that vicinity.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,615, of whom 1,353 were native and 262 foreign born.&nbsp; The township contains twelve schools, and gives employment to sixteen teachers.&nbsp; The average number of scholars for the year of 1878 was 266; and the amount expended for the support of the schools during the same period was $2,241.54.
