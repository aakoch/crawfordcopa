<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Troy was formed in 1830.&nbsp; Its area is seventeen thousand five hundred and eighty-one acres.&nbsp; Population in 1870 was nine hundred and eighty-three.&nbsp; James Luse, from New Jersey, in 1795, was the pioneer of this section.&nbsp; His location was on the farm occupied by his grandson, Robert A. Luse.&nbsp; At that time there was no settler within a radius of nine miles.&nbsp; How would the present generation have emulated Luse?&nbsp; In the solitude of the forest would come thoughts of a far-away, early home, of absent friends, of youthful scenes, and festive enjoyment; and such reflections gave a sombre hue to pioneer life in the heart of a great wilderness.&nbsp; Woman had her full share, but, so far, brief mention, in the discomforts of this forest life.&nbsp; No wonder that on her first introduction to the log cabin, wood-encircled, her heart sank within her.&nbsp; No wonder if, when her children asked her, "Mother, is this home?" her only answer was a gush of tears.&nbsp; Sweet memories of distant friends, church privileges, and a thousand nameless comforts, contrasting, made the situation painful.&nbsp; But, turning to the future, an old age was seen in the midst of happy homes.&nbsp; It was glorious to have taken part in so grand a development of the land.&nbsp; The forest fell, population came, and again the amenities and comforts of society were enjoyed; again the church and school advantages were realized.&nbsp; Luse brought the third wagon from Pittsburgh for Meadville.&nbsp; In 1833 Jacob Rishel accompanied his father from Cooperstown, New York, and settled in Troy Township.&nbsp; A road was cut for the passage of a yoke of oxen for nine miles, at that late date.&nbsp; John McKenzie was a settler about the same time as Rishel, but sold out in March, 1838, to P. Faunce, who located upon the tract which lies in the western part of the township.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are two villages in the township, of small size, known as Troy Centre and Newtontown.&nbsp; The first occupant of the former was a negro named &quot;Black Francis.&quot;&nbsp; The first white resident was Peter Keyes.&nbsp; Newtontown is situated in the eastern part, and has its name from Edmond C. Newton, who located there on January 6, 1847.&nbsp; Newton purchased of Samuel Sinclair, a probable settler from 1817 to date of sale.&nbsp; The improvements of thirty years on two hundred acres of land were a log hut, a saw-mill, and four acres cleared.
