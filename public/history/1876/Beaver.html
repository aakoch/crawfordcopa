<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few old men, with willing spirit but defective memory, supply the meagre outlines of early settlement and pioneer privations.&nbsp; A third generation has well-nigh passed away since those memorable days, when the adventurous pioneer ventured into the forests of Western Pennsylvania, and choosing a tract near river, creek, or spring, reared an humble dwelling; and, going east, returned again with family, sometimes with company, often alone, and incurred hardships, privations, and danger.&nbsp; Traveling a trackless forest, little could be carried with them to insure home comforts.&nbsp; Arrived at the chosen site, how did it appear?&nbsp; Water convenient of access, the log cabin built, and a patch of land cleared of trees, but thick with stumps and charred logs.&nbsp; Where are the neighbors for help in sickness and for friendly intercourse?&nbsp; The echo of a distant axe, and the occasional far-off thunder of a falling tree, tell of some other brave-hearted borderer.&nbsp; Brief mention of a few of the old frontiersmen and initial efforts, looking to a future civilization, are all that can be gained, and these but fragments.&nbsp; Following on the track of a previous compiler, his record is found true in most particulars, and is reproduced with omissions and additions.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The township of Beaver is but a limited portion of what is called Old Beaver, and lies in the northwest corner of the County.&nbsp; Its area is twenty-one thousand six hundred and sixty-eight acres; its surface is level and inclines northward.&nbsp; Its organization dates from 1811.&nbsp; The lands were well wooded, and gave employment in later years to the lumbermen.&nbsp; Settlement became general, and many improvements had begun, when the question of valid claims arose, and many left not to return again.&nbsp; The names of Richard Durham, Philip McGuire, and George and William Foster are associated with early settlement.&nbsp; William Foster, son of George, arrived in the township about the year 1800.&nbsp; He is said to have hauled a barrel of flour upon a hand sled through the woods to his tract; and this, with game from about him, supplied his food.&nbsp; The Fosters settled near the centre of the township, McGuire in the southern part, Silverthorn in the southeast, on a run which took his name, and Thompson in the southwest.&nbsp; Van Crozier, Neild, Larkins, Browns, Gateses, Hollenbecks, and many others, came in and began to make themselves homes.&nbsp; The news of litigation was marked by general abandonment of claims.&nbsp; Richard Durham, Philip McGuire, and George Foster were located on lands not claimed by Holland Company and held their claims by actual settlement.&nbsp; Lotan Reid was a settler in Beaver in 1834.&nbsp; Then, even roads were unknown, and the blazed tree was the pioneer&#146;s guide to and from his wood-encircled home.&nbsp; The first road laid out bore the name of the Old Fisher Road, from a family of the name of Fisher, past whose mills (located in what is now Spring Township) the route lay.&nbsp; Indications of the existence of salt water in the southwest part of the township caused a firm named Clark, Magaw &amp; Shryack to bore a well; the result was a partial success; but the traffic on French Creek rendered it unprofitable, and it was soon abandoned.&nbsp; Lately, borings have been made for oil.&nbsp; Early grist and saw-mills were built; one on a run north of Beaver Centre was called after the builder,&#151;Griswald&#146;s Mill; another near by was erected by Robert Foster.&nbsp; It had a single run of stones, obtained from adjacent rocks.&nbsp; The first saw-mill is accredited to William Plymat, and stood about a mile west of the centre.&nbsp; The initial merchant of Beaver was Lester Griswald, son of Elind, an old resident.&nbsp; There have been no taverns in the township.&nbsp; The first doctor was Dr. Bemers, from Meadville.&nbsp; He came out to attend disbanded soldiers of Harrison&#146;s army taken with typhoid fever.&nbsp; Among early Justices was Ark. Jenks, a man well known and of fair ability.&nbsp; An early marriage was that of William Crozier to Mary Fisher, in the year 1802.&nbsp; Meetings were held by traveling missionaries and preachers sent out from Meadville, and church organization and house-building are of recent date.&nbsp; Education receives fair attention.&nbsp; Manufacture is principally represented by J. W. Wood and Co.&#146;s establishment, started in 1865, and doing a good business in the production of hand-rakes, felloes, spokes, wagon-poles, and shafts.&nbsp; The lowland is rich, and answers well for farming and grazing, and the township is by nature well calculated for these avocations.
