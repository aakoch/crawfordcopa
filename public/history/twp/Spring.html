<a name="N1"><sup>1</sup> </a>Crawford Co. Court of Quarter Sessions, November Session 1829.&nbsp; The Court  &quot;change[d] the name of Snowhill township to be henceforth called Spring township&quot; upon the following petition:
<blockquote>The petition of the undersigned citizens of &quot;Snow Hill&quot; Township respectfully represent.&nbsp; That they have found from evidence which they cannot resist, that the name imported to said township has already had a deleterious influence on the settlement of the large body of vacant land within its bounds.&nbsp; With the term &quot;Hill&quot; is almost invariably associated the idea of sterility of soil, and with the addition of &quot;Snow&quot; strangers are at once impressed with the belief that the beautiful body of land which it embraces, is remarkable only for its sterile hills and frigid temperature. Your petitioners have already found that the name has had a chilling influence on the sale of lands, and the consequent advancement of its population. They would therefore respectfully pray, that it may be changed from &quot;Snow Hill&quot; to Lehman, and your petitioners in duty bound will pray, etc.&nbsp; [signed] Allen Sperry, Harry Hadsell, Jabez Wight, Authur F Joslin, Daniel Joslin, Alvin Hotchkiss, Lewis Sperry, Carson Sloan[?], John  McNier[?], Robert Greenlee, Girdon W Spicer[?], John Greenlee, George Nelson, Jacob Bagley, Isaac Sperry, Robert Temple, Thomas Page, Samuel Main[?], Timothy Bitles[?], Abraham Higenell, Abraham Higenel Jun, John Michel, Wm D[?] Taber[?], Garner Taber[?], Durcas Joslin Jr, Alexander Sweany 2d, James Swany, John Swany Jx[?�possibly his mark]r, John Sweany Seign[i.e., Sr.?], Morgan Swany, Alexander Carlin, Hugh Carlin Sen, Hugh Carlin junr, James Carlin, John Carlin&nbsp; 35 [i.e., the number of signatures] &nbsp; <font size="-2"><a href="#B1">RETURN</a></font>
