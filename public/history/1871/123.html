<center><font size="+2"><a name="Titusville" href="../../places/Titusville.html">TITUSVILLE</a> CITY.
<br>&#151;&#151;</center>

</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville, the Metropolis of the oil region, according to the recent census returns, contains a larger population than any city or town between Erie and Pittsburgh.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville, upon the northern bank of Oil Creek, which at this point hugs the northern bluff, leafing a valley of nearly one mile in width, which is unsurpassed in beauty.&nbsp; The Valley extends for nearly a mile, in a westerly direction, before the view is terminated by a high range of hills, which, in the summer season, afford a picturesque and beautiful setting to so fair a picture below.&nbsp; To the eastward, the eye ranges for nearly three miles, when another series of elevated table-lands seem to mark the terminus of the valley, which, in reality, extends for miles further, though narrowed and ill-fitted for agricultural or grazing purposes, by reason of rocky soil, precipitous bluffs, &c.&nbsp; As seen from the southern bluff, the city extends quite to the western side of the valley, and several very pretty, home-like, residences have been erected on the hill-side, though the declivity is such that building is attended with difficulty.&nbsp; Nearly all of that part of Titusville, lying west of Franklin street, is built upon what was, at one time, the bed of a swamp, a part of which, still undrained, marks the western boundary of the city itself.&nbsp; Looking at the city from the heights&#150;its white houses, its large, handsome, brick business blocks, and the several spires of its churches, give us no intimation of newness, but it partakes of the newness of an old town&#150;though the absence of shade trees, or rather the presence of thousands of young trees, indicate that it has but recently acquired that permanent and steady growth, which has been marked for the past four years.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville owes its importance, rapid growth and prosperity, to the discovery of petroleum in its immediate vicinity, over then years ago, and to the subsequent development of the extensive oil fields of Crawford and Venango counties, now yielding an average daily production of 1600 barrels.&nbsp; Titusville is the favorite residence and resort of oil operators and dealers in petroleum from abroad, and it is the principal manufacturing point for engines, <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>124</b>&gt;</font> oil machinery, and oil supplies for western Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Theoil refining is growing rapidly, and is destined to assume the greatest magnitude and importance.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It contains four banks, on the soundest financial basis, and transacting a most extensive business.&nbsp; Its wholesale and retail grocery, dry goods, clothing, furniture and hardware stores will compare favorably in magnitude of business and geographical extent of trade, with similar establishments in Buffalo, Pittsburgh or Cleveland.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Its Churches represent every Christian denomination.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The buildings are commodious, and the stranger cannot fail to be attracted by the magnificent display, both in their architecture, and general finish.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It boasts of several first-class hotels, and the new <a name="1"></a>Parshall House, soon to be opened to the public, is on the most extensive and elegant scale, in respect to its accommodations, modern improvements and appointments.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It has two public halls&#150;Corinthian Hall, with the capacity of seating 800 persons, and adapted to stage representations; Parshall&#146;s new Opera House, in connection with the Parshall Hotel, with a capacity of seating 1500 persons, constructed, arranged, finished, and embellished according to the most improved modes, and in a style of unsurpassed taste and art.&nbsp; Popular amusements of every description, are most liberally patronized in this city, and draw largely from the surrounding towns and region.&nbsp; An annual winter course of lectures is successfully maintained, and the Young Men&#146;s Christian Association contemplate the early founding of a Public Library.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville possesses one Public Union Graded School of over 600 pupils; and another Public School of equal capacity, and at a cost of $25,000, is in progress of construction.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville is lighted with gas; and a company has been formed for the erection and maintenance of water works, for public and private uses.&nbsp; The present year will witness the construction and laying of sewers, and Nicholson, or similar pavement, in the principal business streets.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="railroads"></a>Titusville has hitherto depended on one line of Railroad for communication with the main Railroad lines and the surrounding country.&nbsp; But a new Railroad is now completed, known as the Union and Titusville Railway, connecting with the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad and the Atlantic and Great Western Railway at Union.&nbsp; Another Railroad connecting Titusville with Meadville, by a direct route, is also in serious contemplation.&nbsp; These various lines <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>125</b>&gt;</font> as estimated, will cheapen the markets of Titusville in every item of family consumption, and bring coal, material and supplies, to the city at such comparatively moderate rates, and offer such easy and rapid communications with the surrounding country, as to encourage and foster manufacturing establishments of various descriptions at this point.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The immense transactions of the oil trade, at this point, have led to a preliminary organization for the purpose of establishing a petroleum-board, or oil exchange, with proper rules and regulations.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Business, of every description, is effected in a sensible degree by the state of the oil market and its fluctuations, but the depression in the market during the past nine months, has established the fact that the business of Titusville stands on a normal and healthy basis, and can stand a twelve month of depression without panic, shock, or serious, or fatal disturbance of commercial affairs.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="newspapers"></a>Titusville, within the last six years, has given birth to a dozen or more newspaper enterprises, daily and weekly.&nbsp; The first daily paper established in the oil region was the Titusville &#147;<i>Morning Herald</i>&#148;&nbsp; Republican in politics, founded June, 1865, it has enjoyed a career of uninterrputed prosperity, until it has attained a size and circulation equal to the leading daily papers of Buffalo, Cleveland and similar cities.&nbsp; Its statistical monthly oil reports, are the standard authority in Europe, as well as this country.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Weekly Herald</i> contains the most interesting matter which has appeared in the <i>Morning Herald</i>, and as it circulates largely in Crawford and Venango counties, it presents invariably the local intelligence of the week, with important court proceedings, jury and trial lists, etc.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; None of the other newspaper ventures have maintained themselves for any length of time.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Titusville <i>Courier</i> was founded in October 1870, is a large and enterprising sheet, comparing favorably with the Titusville <i>Herald</i>, Democratic in politics, conducted with ability, and printed under the auspices of a joint stock association.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Sunday Morning News</i> was lately started, into which the <i>Long Roll</i> was merged.&nbsp; The <i>News</i> was started with the beginning of the new year and is conducted by <a name="2"></a>W. C. Allen, Esq., a gentleman of culture and ability, and in every way the <i>Soldier&#146;s Friend</i>.&nbsp; The paper is devoted principally to the interest of the Soldiers&#146; Orphans and Widows.&nbsp; It is independent in politics.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Titusville, during her whole history, has been remarkably free from epidemic diseases, and is a very healthy locality.&nbsp; With a properly maintained system of drainage and sewers, the city may be kept in a sound sanitary condition.
<br><font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>126</b>&gt;</font>
<br>
<br><center><font size="+2">Titusville&#146;s &nbsp; Future.
<br>&#151;&#151</center></font>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The future of Titusville is full of cheering promise.&nbsp; When an intelligent municipal government, acting in concert with a liberal and progressive constituency, shall have carried out an extensive system of the most improved kind of street pavement and sewerage, as it proposes to do, the present year, Titusville will then stand on a permanent basis of business growth, and private enjoyment and comfort, which nothing else could secure.&nbsp; Then, with railroads radiating from the city, in every direction, manufactures of various kinds can be profitably entered on, and engaged in, in Titusville.&nbsp; There is also every indication that Titusville is destined to become a great refining mart, second to no other city.&nbsp; The mercantile interests of Titusville, its jobbing and retail department are destined to draw custom and support from a growing home population, not only, but a still wide circumference of territory around, and with Churches and schools, hotels, and public halls, the inducements held out, especially to oil operators and dealers, to make Titusville their place of residence, and home, are, in a social, as well as business point of view, unrivalled.&nbsp; Titusville has always paid the highest wages to the mechanic and laboring class, and its incipient building enterprises, and the steady growth of its population are likely to maintain them at a high point while real estate and rents shall hold their present high rate of valuation, and until the cost of living shall be materially reduced.&nbsp; There are in Titusville, more men of large wealth, than in any other city of its size in the United States, men of acquired not hereditary wealth, and who are in middle life, or below that period, and who are notably men of progressive tendencies, liberal ideas, and benificent impulses, and it is not improbable that the day is not far distant when our city will be furnished and graced by private munificence, with public parks, a well appointed public library, high schools of learning, museums of science and art, <i>et cetera</i>, after the distinguished example of public benefactors, in other cities.

<br>
<br><center><font size="+2">The &nbsp; Oil &nbsp; Trade.
<br>&#151;&#151</center></font>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The following statistics of the Petroleum trade of this region we extract from the <i>Morning Herald&#146;s</i> annual Petroleum report:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The total production of petroleum for the month of December amounted to 472,355 bbls., making an average daily production of 15,214 bbls., or a daily decrease of 2,700 bbls. for the month under review.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The daily decrease, as shown by individual reports from the different tracts and farms in the oil region was about 2,900 bbls. over all increase, but as previously stated, the <i>Herald&#146;s</i> figures relating to production are based upon stocks in the region at the beginning and close of the month, and the shipments from the oil region by all lines of railroad, and by river.&nbsp; The large decrease in the yield for December is mainly due to excessive cold weather prevailing for about ten days during the month, and which in nearly every part of the producing region served to freeze the water pipes of the smaller wells especially, and thus prevent pumping, a fact which materially cut off the supply of petroleum for the month.&nbsp; In the larger producing districts of West Hickory, <a name="3"></a>McCray Farm and Parker&#146s Landing the yield would undoubtedly exhibit a marked decline, even had the cold weather not caused a partial suspension of operations.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The following table shows the production during December, 1870:

<br><center>THE&nbsp; STOCK.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; At the close of the year the entire stock of the oil region amounted to 537,751 barrels of 43 gallons each, or 16,775 barrels less than at the close of 
<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>128</b>&gt;</font> 
November.&nbsp; The stock in iron tankage was about 24,000 barrels less than at the beginning of the month.&nbsp; The stocks at the wells about 3,000 barrels in excess, while the Refiners and Pipe Co.&#146;s stock throughout the region was about 4,000 more than on December 1st.&nbsp; In a few instances the stock reported at the wells were in iron tanks, but in no case has any duplication occurred, and all stocks of refiners and pipe companies have been classed under that head whether in iron or wooden tankage.
<br>
<br><center>THE&nbsp; SHIPMENTS.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The shipments of crude and its equivalent during the month of December were about seventy-three thousand barrels less than those of the preceding month, and were less upon every line of railroad leading from the region.&nbsp; The shipments by river were about 36,000 bbls, in excess of those by the same route in December, and were principally from Parker&#146;s Landing, Oleopolis and Oil City.

<br>
<br>&#151;&#151;
<br>
<br><a name="4"></a>S. &nbsp; J. &nbsp; MYERS&#146;S &nbsp; FURNITURE &nbsp; MANUFACTORY.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This extensive establishment is located near the Union and Titusville Railroad, one mile west of Titusville.&nbsp; The building is three stories high and covers and area of 45x180 feet, fitted up expressly for furniture manufacture, and is complete in general construction and detail.
<br>
<br><center>THE &nbsp;FIRST &nbsp;FLOOR.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this department the lumber is dressed, sized and shaped, including mortising and molding, and everthing but finishing.
<br>
<br><center>THE &nbsp;SECOND &nbsp;FLOOR</center>
<br>is the fitting and ornamenting department.&nbsp; Here the black walnut sets, ranging in value from $100 to $500, according to ornament, are fitted and set up ready for staining or varnishing.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not necessary to particularize the different articles manufactured at the Factory.&nbsp; Suffice that every wooden article of household furniture, in kitchen, parlor, or chamber, has a counterpart here.
<br><font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>129</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Forty men are employed, making an aggregate annual pay-roll of $40,000.&nbsp; The capital represented is $50,000.00.&nbsp; It can be easily seen what an element of stability and prosperity such an establishment is to this city.&nbsp; Here we have it shown that manufacturing can be carried on to any extent in our city.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This establishment is one of the most thorough, reliable, and energetic business houses in North Western Pennsylvania, and does not have its superior anywhere in point of honorable reputation and stability.
<br>
<br><center>PETROLEUM &nbsp;IRON &nbsp;WORKS.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; These works are owned by <a name="5"></a>Bryan, <a name="6"></a>Dillingham & Co., and are situated on Franklin street, near the U. &amp; T. and O.C. R&#146;ys, were established in 1861, by Bryan and <a name="7"></a>McMullen.&nbsp; In its infancy it was but a small affair, but through the skillful management of the present firm it now has no rival in Western Pennsylvania.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The result of the energy then put into the business developed itself very speedily, and now shows itself in new and extended buildings, the employment of about 200 men, with an average weekly pay-roll for labor of $2,500 or $140,000 per year.&nbsp; The business of the last year was over $800,000 with a steady increase, which promises soon to demand a very large addition to the facilities of the works.&nbsp; Their products consist of Engines, Refiners&#146; Machinery, Oil Well Tools, and Oil Well supplies.&nbsp; The individual members of the firm are <a name="8"></a>J. C. Bryan, <a name="9"></a>Jno. Dillingham, <a name="10"></a> W. W. Kingsland, <a name="11"></a>O. Keese and <a name="12"></a>E. W. Stratton, gentlemen who are known to be competent and thorough in everything they undertake.&nbsp; Enough has been said to show that the Petroleum Iron Works is a concern of more than ordinary importance, both as regards it connection with the propserty of Titusville and its excellence as an institution.

<br>
<br>&#151;&#151;</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; These works were established in 1865, by the present proprietors, Gibbs, Russell &amp; Co.&nbsp; The individual members of the concern are <a name="73"></a>F. H. Gibbs, <a name="74"></a> Jno. T. Russell and <a name="75"></a>Wm. B. Sterrett.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The works are located on Monroe street, near the corner of Mechanic, and cover an area of about five acres.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; They are conveniently arranged, and the style and quality of the work done, is such as few manufacturing establishments can boast of.&nbsp; The character of the work is mostly confined to the manufacture of Engines, Boilers, and Oil Well and Refiner&#146;s supplies, yet a general Iron Founder&#146;s and Forger&#146;s business is carried on.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The business for the past year was about $800,000, the average weekly pay-roll amounting to over $3,000, or $156,000 per year.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The management of the Novelty Iron Works and its extensive business, enjoy an enviable reputation throughout the country, and are universally regarded as among the foremost of those who contribute to the improvement and growth of our city.
