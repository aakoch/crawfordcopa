</center><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The borough of Venango is beautifully situated on the west bank of Venango River.&nbsp; Around is a rich agricultural country, dotted with pleasant farms and well cultivated fields, and owned by a people who are excellent by none in all the qualities of good citizenship.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tract of land Venango is built on was settled by P<a name="S1"></a>hillip Straw, from Westmoreland county, in the year 1800.&nbsp; He sold to <a name="S2></a>John Sasher and <a name="S3></a>Solomon Walters in 1817.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They laid out a village plot, in anticipation of the turnpike coming through this place ;&nbsp; but, it not coming, Venango still remained in comparative obscurity.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1820, <a name="S4"></a>Michael Peiffer purchased the interest of Solomon Walters, comprising the principal part of the present village.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1829, <a name="S5"></a>Asa Freeman bought the mill privilege and eighteen acres of land, including a saw-mill, built by Michael Peiffer and <a name="S6"></a>Jacob Sherrets.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1832, <a name="S7"></a>John Kleckner emigrated here from Lycoming county, bought the Michael Peiffer tract, with the mill property ;&nbsp; also, the <a name="S8"></a>Christopher Siverling (now the <a name="S9"></a>Tarr) farm.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same year, he built a new saw-mill, and repaired the old one.&nbsp; In 1838, he had the old village lot surveyed, and named it Klecknerville, making a new addition in 1847-49.&nbsp; In 1852, the borough was incorporated under the name of Venango.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has a population of about four hundred.&nbsp; The town contains a grist-mill, two saw-mills, woolen factory, steam tannery, wagon and carriage shop, three churches.&nbsp; The commercial business, in its various branches, is well represented.&nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western Railway passes through the town, on the opposite side of French Creek.
