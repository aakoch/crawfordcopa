<br><font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The earliest Constitutions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania mandated an "enumer-ation of taxable inhabitants" every seven years, "in such manner as shall be directed by law."<a name="N1" a href="#N_1_"><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></a>&nbsp; The legislature responded, beginning in 1779, with a succession of statutes providing for such a state census.<a name="N2" a href="#N_2_"><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup></a>&nbsp; These statutes directed county commissioners to have their tax assessors (or other appointees) prepare alphabetical lists of the names, together with occupations, of all taxable persons aged 21 years or older actually residing within their respective township, ward, or district.&nbsp; One copy of the returns was to be filed with the clerk of the county court of quarter sessions,<a name="N3" a href="#N_3_"><sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup></a> and "duplicates" sent to the Governor for presentation to the General Assembly.&nbsp; The principal purpose of the enumeration was apportionment, i.e., determining representation in the state legislature.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth septennial census was to be taken before 31 July 1800.<a name="N4" a href="#N_4_"><sup><font size="-1">4</font></sup></a>&nbsp; Although Crawford and adjacent counties had been created from Allegheny County on 12 March 1800, all townships in northwestern Pennsylvania were returned as part of Allegheny County.<a name="N5" a href="#N_5_"><sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup></a>&nbsp; The three townships covering Crawford County are transcribed here verbatim from the microfilmed duplicates, except that "Ditto," "Do," and other forms of "the same" (in reference to occupations) have been rendered with apostrophes.<a name="N6" a href="#N_6_"><sup><font size="-1">6</font></sup></a>&nbsp; Question marks, where legibility is poor, and other editorial additions have been placed inside square brackets.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lists are valuable in showing occupations, which are not given in the 1800 federal census returns<a name="N7" a href="#N_7_"><sup><font size="-1">7</font></sup></a> or (unless taxable) tax rolls.<a name="N8" a href="#N_8_"><sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup></a>&nbsp; They also include some individuals not found on the tax duplicates or in the federal census (possibly because they were not heads of households).
