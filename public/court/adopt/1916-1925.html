I have exhausted all avenues in this venture and it was suggested to me by my father mothers&#146; sister-in-law that you may have records of my birth in your office and that you could possibly send me a copy of same. There is some information I have been able to find out through various sources. However I must have a birth certificate in order to obtain a passport for areas I plan to visit and in a few years will need it for Social Security benefits.

Eberman and Ethel Irene Eberman when I was 2 weeks old in Meadville Pennsylvania where my foster parents lived and was named Jean Barbara Eberman.&nbsp; 7. I lived in Meadville & was baptized in the Congregational Church (they have no record of birth place either) on Park Avenue until I was eight or nine years old.&nbsp; 8.

Hannah, a resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania and sole surviving grand-parent of the above named minor children, Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, by C. Victor Johnson, Esq., and O. Clare Kent, Esq., and objects to the granting of the prayer of the petitioner in this case and respectfully moves the Court to quash and dismiss the said petition filed, and assigns the following reasons in support thereof:&mdash; [&#182] First:&ndash; That James R. Hannah, resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, is the sole surviving grandparent of the said named minor children; he being the paternal grand-father, the paternal grand-mother and both maternal grand parents having died before the death of the parents of the said named minor children. [&#182;] Second:&ndash; That legally, James R. Hannah is the nearest next of kin to the said children and by lines of consanguinity and affinity their nearest surviving relative, which ipso facto makes him the legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of said minor children and the proper and legal person to give consent to the proposed adoption. [&#182;] Third:&ndash; That before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition, filed in this case, it is necessary, under the requirements of the Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth, relating to the adoption of children, to-wit, the Acts of 1855, P.L. 430, of 1887, P.L. 125, P.L. 380, that the petition must contain, as a part thereof, the written consent of the legal and recognized next friend of the child or children sought to be adopted; which in this case is James R. Hannah, their paternal grand-father, who hereby objects to the proposed adoption of the said named children and witholds [<i>sic</i>] his consent thereto. [&#182;] Fourth:&ndash; That the Court has no power, authority or jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because Herman A. Williams, a maternal uncle of said children, is not the legally authorized and recognized next friend or person clothed with the legal authority and right to give consent to the said proposed adoption. [&#182;] Fifth:&ndash; That the Court has no power, authority or jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because the Overseers of the Poor of Crawford County, to-wit, H.C. Wasson and A. E. Lilly, have no legal authority, right or standing to give their consent to the proposed adoption; the said named children, sought to be adopted, never having become a charge upon the said County of Crawford and they having a paternal grand-father in full life and of sufficient ability to relieve and maintain them as is required by the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, viz:&ndash; The Act of June 13th, 1836 P.L. 539. [&#182;] Sixth:&ndash; The Court is also moved to enter an order in the said stated case, permitting and allowing a reasonable and sufficient time for the filing of an answer to the petition filed, after the final disposition of this Motion to Quash, if it is the opinion of the Honorable Court that this motion should be dismissed and an answer to the petition as filed be required.&nbsp; And he will ever pray &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed O.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [(Typed) Opinion and Order of Prather, President Judge, &#147;Sur Demurrer to Petition,&#148; filed 15 Dec. 1919:]&nbsp; &#147;The children named are the minor children of Glen and Harriet Hannah, deceased.&nbsp; The only surviving grandparent is James S. Hannah.&nbsp; The Petition for adoption has the consent of the Overseers of the Poor and a maternal uncle as next friend, joining in the prayer. [&#182;] The Act of 1887, P. L.125, amending Sec. 7 of the Act of 1856, P. L. 430, and its amendment dated May 28, 1915, P. O. 580, prescribe the jurisdictional requisites of such petition.&nbsp; Bearing in mind that the father and mother are both dead, so much of Sec. 7 of said act as is applicable to the present contention reads: [&#182;, indented] &#145;The Court may with the consent of the next friend of such child, or the guardians or overseers of the poor, or of such charitable institution as shall have supported such child for at least one year, decree&#146, etc. [&#182;] The question raised by the demurrer is whether the parties consenting to such adoption come within the statutes as &#145;next friend&#146; or as consent<strike>i</strike>able parties. [&#182;] As the proceeding is statutory, all the authorities agree that &#145;Its requirements must be followed in order to give the Court jurisdiction&#146;. [&#182;, indented] Keeler&#146;s Adoption, 52 S.C. 516. [next line] Vandermis vs Gilbert, 10 S. C., 570. [&#182;] It is contended that the statutory requirements are met in this case by obtaining the consent of the Overseers of the Poor.&nbsp; The logic of this contention is that the legislature meant that either the next friend, or the &#145;guardians or overseers of the poor&#146; stood in an equal consent[<strike>i</strike>able relation to the proceeding; hence the petitioner could exercise his option to secure either. [&#182;] The language taken alone might fairly warrant this interpretation, but considering the entire section and the far reaching consequences of the decree, reason as well as authority seems to require a different conclusion.&nbsp; Minor orphans having property are no more likely to become a charge upon the overseers of the poor than are minors with parents who have no property.&nbsp; In fact, such parents with their children may become a charge upon such overseers, and more probably so than the orphaned minors with property.&nbsp; Hence, unless such responsibility of maintenance has fallen upon the county or the probability of its doing so is manifest from the pleadings, the intervention of such overseers, though well meant, would seem presumptuous. [&#182;] This conclusion is the more apparent when we consider that the Act of 1915 makes such an adopting parent heir of the adopted child as though a natural parent.&nbsp; The result of such a decree in many instances would change the line of inheritance and divert inheritable property by descent to strangers who otherwise would be but aliens to the estate. [&#182;, indented] See Booth vs Van Allen, 7 Phila, 401. [next line] In re Reuben H. Davis, 13 D. R., 688. [&#182;] The question presented does not seem to have been ruled upon by the appellate courts of our State.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Iowa, in Holmes vs. Derrig, 103 N. W., 973, in passing upon the Iowa statute quite similar to our own, held that when the father and mother of a child are both dead, the grandparents were the &#145;next of kin&#146;, and that the consent of a grandparent was a prerequisite to a decree of adoption. [&#182;, indented] See in Benton, 80 N. W. (Iowa) 614. [&#182;] Under the facts a maternal uncle is not the &#145;next of kin&#146; within the meaning of the statute. [&#182;] We are therefore of the opinion that we are compelled to sustain the demurrer. [&#182;] Our decision has no relation to the merits of the question of the custody of these children.&nbsp; We cannot in this proceeding inquire into or consider the advisability of granting the prayer of the petition.&nbsp; We are simply responding to the limitations of our power as circumscribed by the law. [centered] ORDER [&#182;] Now, December 13, 1919, demurrer sustained and petition dismissed.&nbsp; Per Curiam.&#148;

Hannah, be adopted as and for their children and heirs, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly in such cases made and provided, said children to have all the rights of an actual child, and to assume the name of the petitioners, and that they shall have all the rights and be subject to all the duties of children and heirs, equally with any other child or children of your petitioners.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Separate (typed) &#147;Protest of James R. Hannah to Adoption, and Demurrer to Petition,&#148;:]&nbsp; &#147;Now Dec. 30<font size="-1"><sup><u>th</u></sup></font>, 1921 [day handwritten], comes James R. Hannah, a resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, and sole surviving grand parent of the above named minor children, Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, by C. Vicgor [<i>sic</i>] Johnson and O. Clare Kent, his attorneys, and objects to the granting of the prayer of the petitioner in this case, and respectfully moves the Court to quash and dismiss the said petition, and assigns the following reasons in support thereof: [&#182] 1st: That James R. Hannah, a resident of the city of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, is the sole surviving grand-parent of the said named minor children, he being the paternal grand-father, the paternal grand-mother and both maternal grand-parents having died before the death of the parents of the said named minor children. [&#182;] 2nd: That legally James R. Hannah is the nearest next of kin to the said children, and by lines of consanguinity and affinity their nearest surviving relative, which, <u>ipso facto</u>, makes him the legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of the said minor children, and the proper and lawful person to give consent to the proposed adoption. [&#182;] 3rd: That before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition filed in this case, it is necessary, under the requirements of the acts of assembly of this commonwealth, relating to the adoption of children, to-wit, the Act of 1855, PL 430, the act of 1887, PL 125, and the act of 1915, PL 580, that the petition must contain as a part thereof, the written consent of the legal and recognized next friend of the child or children sought to be adopted, which in this case is James R. Hannah, their paternal grand-father, who hereby objects to the proposed adoption of the said named children and withholds his consent thereto. [&#182;] 4th: That the court has no jurisdiction, authority, or power to entertain the petition filed in this case, because Edward L. Williams, a maternal uncle of said children and a non-resident of the state of Pennsylvania, and J. P. Williams, a grand-uncle of said children, are not the legally authorized and recognized next friends or persons clothed with the legal authority and right to give consent to the said proposed adoption. [&#182;] 5th: That the questions and matters involved in this proceeding are, res ajudicata, the same having been presented to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, upon petition of Charles L. Shaw and Margaret W. Shaw, filed at No. <a href="#192002020">20 February Term 1920</a>, and praying for a decree of adoption for the said Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, minor children of J. Glenn Hannah and Harriet B. Hannah, deceased, which said petition, demurrer thereto, and the action of the court thereon are as follows: [entire proceedings therein transcribed, but omitted here]. [&#182;] 6th: That since the disposition by this Honorable Court on the former application for the adoption of these same children by the same petitioners, the said child, Charles G. Hannah has been placed, together with his two brothers, James A. Hannah and John E. Hannah, in the Odd Fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pennsylvania, to-wit, on the 7th day of April, 1920, by Crawford Lodge No. 734, of Meadville, Pa., of which said Lodge the deceased father was a member, in compliance with a request of the deceased parents of said children made shortly before their deaths, and since which time said children have been kept and maintained by the said Orphan&#146;s Home, excepting that the said James R. Hannah, protestant, has contributed much, if not all, of their clothing, as well as money and other things, and articles for their comfort and maintenance, and the protestant now submits and contends that it would not be for the best interest of said child, Charles G. Hannah, to remove him therefrom and from the society and association of his two brothers. [&#182;] 7th: That the said child, Charles G. Hannah, has been supported in the Odd Fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pa., a charitable institution, for more than one year prior to the filing of the petition in this case, and that before the court can entertain jurisdiction thereof, the consent of the guardians or overseers of said Institution must be obtained, as required by the acts of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in such cases made and provided. [&#182;] 8th: That the protestant, James R. Hannah, the paternal grandfather of said children, is now, and since the death of their parents has been greatly interested in the welfare of said children, has contributed toward their support, maintenance and comfort, and will continue such contributions in the future. That said children possess individual estates in the hands of their guardian, the New First National Bank of Meadville, Pa., inherited from their parents, and a portion of which has been contributed by the said protestant, and that a decree of adoption in this case prayed for, would change the line of inheritance, and might divert inheritable property by descent to strangers who otherwise would be aliens to the estate. [&#182;] 9th: That the said petitioners, Charles L. Shaw and Margaret F. Shaw are not fit, proper and suitable persons to be given the care, custody, control, raising and training of said minor children, and that a decree of adoption in this case would not be for the best interests of the said minor child. [&#182;] 10th: Wherefore, the Court is respectfully moved to enter an order in the said stated case, quashing and dismissing the petition filed herein. [&#182;] And he will ever pray, &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed C. Victor Johnson, O. Clare Kent, Attorneys for James R. Hannah; sworn to by James R. Hannah and subscribed J. R. Hannah before V. L. Greeley, Prothonotary, 29 Nov. 1921; filed 30 Nov. 1921, with handwritten notation, &#147;Legal argument Dec 8 1921 @ 10 A M&nbsp; Per Cur[iam]&#148;
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Separate (typed) response, described on cover in handwriting as &#147;Answer of Petitioners for adoption, to Protest of James R. Hannah against, and Motion to Dismiss Petition for, adoption,&#148;:]&nbsp; &#147;Now, December 8, 1921 [with &#145;8&#146; handwritten], Come Charles L. Shaw and Margaret W. Shaw, the petitioners in the above captioned case, by John O. McClintock and Walter J. McClintock, their Attorneys, and in answer to the protest of James R. Hannah against the granting of the petition of the petitioners for the adoption of said minor children, and his motion to dismiss said petition heretofore filed, respectfully say:- [&#182;] 1. The petitioners admit that the said James R. Hannah is now the only surviving grandparent of the minor children for whose adoption the petition in this case was filed, but he was not the only surviving grandparent of said children at the time of the death of their parents, their grandparent Alfred D. Williams, then being alive, whose death has since occurred. [&#182;] 2. They deny that the said James R. Hannah is the only next of kin of the said children, and that he is the only legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of said children, and the only proper and lawful person to give consent to the proposed adoption, and aver that the said children have for next of kin and for next friends, three uncles, brothers of their deceased mother, namely: Herman A. Williams, John L. Williams and Edward L. Williams, one granduncle, John P. Williams, and one aunt, sister of the deceased mother of said children, Margaret W. Shaw, all of whom are next friends of said minor children, and are proper persons to give consent to the adoption of said minor children. [&#182;] 3. They deny that before the court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition filed in this case it is necessary under the requirements of the Act of Assembly of May 28, 1915, relating to adoption, under which this proceeding was instituted, that the petition must contain as a part thereof the written consent of James R. Hannah, their paternal grandfather, but aver t [next line] that they have attached to their petition the written consent to the adoption of said children by the petitioners of Edward L. Williams, an uncle of said children, and the written consent of John P. Williams, a grand-uncle of said children, as next friends of said children, who are interested in the welfare of said children to such an extent as to see that proper persons are interested with their rearing, which written consents are a full compliance with the requirements of the Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth relative to adoption, and therefore the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition in this case. [&#182;] 4. They deny the allegations of the protestant that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because Edward L. Williams, a maternal uncle, and John P. Williams, a grand-uncle, of said children are the legally authorized [next two words carreted] and recognized next friends or persons clothed with legal authority and right to give consent to said proposed adoption, and aver that the consent given by said uncle and grand-uncle is the consent of the next friend contemplated by the Act of Assembly relating to adoption proceedings, as adjudged by law. [&#182;] 5. They deny that the questions involved in this proceeding are res adjudicata. They admit that the proceedings mentioned in the protestant&#146;s petition as having been before and passed upon by this court at <a href="#192002020">No. 20 February Term 1920</a>, were had and that the petition in said case was dismissed on December 18, 1919, but they aver that since the order of dismissal of the said petition was made the question involved has been passed upon by the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by a decision handed down July 14, 1920, and the law bearing upon the question involved in said case has been declared to be contrary to the <strike>decision</strike> <strike>in</strike> <strike>the</strike> conclusion reached by the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County above mentioned, <strike>w</strike> [next line] wherein said appellate court declared that &#145;on a petition for the adoption of two children, the consent of a grand-uncle as next friend is a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the acts of assembly relative to adoption, and this is the case, even although the grandparents of the children are living&#146;, Wherefore, the petitioners maintain and aver that the petition in this case is within and subject to the jurisdiction of this court. [&#182;] 6. It is admitted that the child Charles G. Hannah, together with his b [next line] brothers, has been placed in the Odd Fellow Orphas [<i>sic</i>] Home, of Meadville, Pa., but it is denied that the said child was placed there at the request of the parents of said children, made shortly before their deaths, but on the contrary, it is averred, that the said child Charles G. Hannah was placed in [next page] in said home at the instance of the said grand-father, for the purpose of defeating the efforts of the petitioners to procure a decree of adoption of the said child, and the said grand-father has threatened to take the child Margaret F. Hannah away from the possession and custody of the petitioners, where she has been ever since the death of the parents of said children, and placing her in the said Home for the same purpose. [&#182;] Your petitioners further aver that it would be most conducive and to the best welfare of both said children that they be adopted by the petitioners so as to provide for them, together, a permanent home. [&#182;] 7. The petitioners deny that before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the said child Charles G. Hannah, the consent of the guardians or overseers of the Odd fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pa. must be obtained, the said Institution not having any right to the possession or control of said child paramount to or that would be superior to or that would conflict or interfere with the power of the court to make the decree of adoption prayed for in this case, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of May 28, 1915. [&#182;] 8. The petitioners do now [<i>sic</i>; not?] know, and they aver that it is immaterial and irrevelant [<i>sic</i>], whether or not the said James R. Hannah has contributed toward the support, maintenance and comfort of said minors, or that he proposes to [next line] to continue such contributions in the future. And as to sucg [<i>sic</i>] estates as said children may possess, the law will make provision for the disposition thereof, in case of adoption of the ow<strike>e</strike>ners of such estates, and that matter has no place in the consideration of the questions involved in this case. [&#182;] 9. That as to the question of the fitness of the petitioners to assume the care, custody, control, raising and training of said children, it is a matter entirely for the consideration of the court and the petitioners are willing to submit the same to and abide by the judgment of the court which may be reached upon the hearing of the case when presented. [&#182;] 10. Wherefore, the petitioners respectfully request the court to vacate and set aside the petition of the said James R. Hannah to quash and dismiss the petition in this case, and to fix a time for the hearing of the petition on its merits. [&#182;] And they will ever pray, &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed John O McClitnock, Walter J. McClintock, Attorneys for Petitioners; [attached jurat:]&nbsp; &#147;Charles L. Shaw being duly sworn according to law deposes and says that the facts set forth in the foregoing answer to the protest of James R. Hannah and motion to quash and dismiss the petition of Charles L. Shaw and Margaret L. Shaw for the adoption of Chales [<i>sic</i>] G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, are correct and true as he verily believes.&#148;; sworn to and subscribed Chas. L Shaw before V. L. Greely, Prothonotary, 8 Dec. 1921; filed 2 Jan. 1922.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Order:]&nbsp; &#147;The first technical question raised, striking at the rest of this proceeding is, that the question involved is Res adjudicate [i.e., already decided, and the decision binding]. [&#182;] It appears from the pleadings filed, that the same petitioners filed a similar petition at No. <a href="#192002020">20 February Term, 1920</a>, in the Court of Common Pleas, praying for a decree of adoption of the same children; that a demurrer was filed thereto, alleging that said petition did not have the consent of the proper &#145;next friend&#146; of said children, in that it had only the consent of a maternal uncle, instead of a surviving grandparent; that said demurrer was sustained by the Court for the reason alleged, as appears by opinion filed December 13, 1919, without any consideration of the merits of the case. [&#182;] It is contended that our order then made it res adjudicate.&nbsp; Since filing said opinion, the Superior Court, in McGinniss&#146; Adoption, 74 S.C. 523-525, have held that the &#145;next friend&#146; is not restricted to grandparents, but a granduncle has a standing within the statute to give such consent, and said: [&#182;, indented] &#145;It is for the Court to determine whether the person consenting is really the next friend&#146;. [&#182;] Petitioner&#146;s case, therefore, went out of court on a mere technicality, concerning the law applicable thereto the court and counsel were in error. [&#182;] The heart of the controversy, then before the court, was in our jurisdiction, it being averred that the proper parties had <strike>n</strike> [next line] not joined in the petition. [&#182;] In the case of Birch v. Andrews Mill Co. 52 S.C. 193, we quote from the syllabus: [&#182;, indented] &#145;A judgment sustaining a demurrer is not res adjudicate to a second suit on the same cause of action, where the plaintiff has paid the costs of the first suit.&#146; [&#182;, indented] The court concluded as follows: [&#182;, indented] &#145;It is perfectly apparent that the first suit did not try and determine the question in controversy in the present one.&nbsp; The first was decided on a technicality and did not touch the merits of the present controversy.&#146; [&#182;] In Weigley vs. Coffman, 144 Pa. 489-499, the Supreme Court Held: [&#182;, indented] &#145;That a cause of action once finally determined without appeal between the parties, on the merits, by any competent tribunal, cannot afterwards be litigated by new proceedings, either before the same or any other tribunal.&nbsp; But no such effect is attributable to a decree dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, failure of prosecution, want of parties, or any other cause not involving the essential merits of the controversy; and where in the answer various matters of defence are set forth, some of which only relate to the maintenance of the suit and others to the merits, and there is a general decree of bill dismissed, from which it does not appear what was the prevailing ground of defence, it is impossible to hold that the decree operates to preclude future proceedings. [&#182;, indented] In Walden v. Bodley, 14 Pet. 156, it was held that a decree dismissing a bill in chancery generally, may be set up in bar of a second bill; but where the bill has been dismissed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction, which shows that the merits were not heard, the dismissal is not a bar to a second bill.&nbsp; To the same effect, also, is Hughes v. United States, 4 Wall. 232.&nbsp; From the authorities cited and the reasons assigned therein, it is plain that, when a bill is dismissed upon the ground of want of jurisdiction, the dismissal cannot be said to be upon the merits; for, whether the action of the court be right or wrong, the complainant&#146;s title to relief sought is not thereby determined.&#146; [&#182;, further indented] See Pittsbg Coal Co. v. RR Co. 227 Pa. 91-104 [next line] Roney v. Westlake, 216 Pa. 374, 380 [next line] Haws v. Tiernan, 53 Pa. 192, 194, [next line] Carmony v. Hoober, 5 Pa. 305, 307, [next line] Klick v. Gernert, 220 Pa. 503. [&#182;] In consideration of the whole matter, we are of the opinion the plea of res adjudicata cannot be sustained, and therefore, that the question is properly before us for consideration upon its [word interlined] merits. [&#182;] It follows that respondents&#146; demurrer and rule to dismiss the petition should be discharged. [&#182;, centered] ORDER. [&#182;] Now, January 2nd, 1922, protest and demurrer overruled and rule to dismiss petition is discharged.&nbsp;Per Curiam.&#148;; filed 2 Jan. 1921 [<i>sic</i>; 1922].
