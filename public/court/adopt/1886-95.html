<blockquote>[Enclosed letter typed on Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company stationery:]&nbsp; &#147;Office of Trainmaster, Durand, Michigan, Jan. 9, 1939 [addressed to] Probate Court&nbsp Crawford County, Meadville, Penna. [&#182;] Dear Sir: [&#182;] Our employee, James Frederick Page, now living at 932 Lomita Avenue, Flint, and engaged as a Switchman, is being required to furnish birth certificate or satisfactory proof of age, and in conversation with I have learned the following facts; [&#182;] He was born November 1, 1889 at Oil City, Venango County, Pennsylvania and was adopted by Louis and Almia Page, when about four years of age.&nbsp; Adoption papers were filed through the Court of Crawford County, and he has no knowledge of his original name or history. [&#182;] It is necessary that we have something definite from the State of Pennsylvania, also the County of Venango as to any registration of birth (after we have developed his original name) or a copy of the adoption papers, if in order.&nbsp; If it is not in order for the Court to furnish this information, a letter or affidavit indicating what the adoption records show as to his name and date of birth, together with information as to date of adoption, will suffice. [&#182;] I am writing this letter for Mr. Page and you may reply to me direct, or to our employee at his home address &ndash; 928 Lomita Avenue, Flint, Michigan. [&#182;] Yours Sincerely,&#148; signed G A Briggs, Trainmaster.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Attached letter from Paul D. Slayton, Prothonotary, addressed to Mr. G. A. Briggs:] &#147; &#8230; I can find no adoption of a child of that name by Louis and Alma Page indexed in our records.&nbsp; However, I find that F. L. Page of Bloomfied Township (about 20 miles N.E. of Meadville) adopted one James Milliman, child of George and Harriet Milliman, on Sept. 14, 1891.&nbsp; The petition sets forth that the child was then about four years old.&nbsp; Quite likely this is an other person [!?!].&#148;</blockquote>
