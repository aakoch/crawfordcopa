<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="+1">Presented here in chronological order are all coroner&#146;s inquests from the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Justices of the Peace were also authorized to hold courts of inquisition whenever the county coroner&#146;s office was located more than ten miles from where the body was found, or the coroner unavailable.<a href="#N1" name="RET1"><font size="-1"><b><sup>1</sup></b></font></a>&nbsp; Such inquests were to be submitted to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace, for judicial approval, along with murder inquests conducted by the coroner.<a href="#N2" name="RET2"><font size="-1"><b><sup>2</sup></b></font></a>&nbsp;
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Those papers which somehow became separated from Crawford County Quarter Sessions records were presented in Volume 2, No. 1 (January 1979) of <i>Crawford County Genealogy</i> (with a much fuller introduction), accompanied by relevant newspaper articles and estate proceedings.&nbsp;  Citations to the prior compilation have been included, with the addition of probate records from the Orphans&#146; Court.</font>
