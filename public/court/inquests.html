<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="+1">Justices of the Peace were authorized to hold courts of inquisition whenever the county coroner&#146;s office was located more than ten miles from where the body was found, or the coroner unavailable.<a href="#N1" name="RET1"><font size="-1"><b><sup>1</sup></b></font></a>&nbsp; Such inquests were to be submitted to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace, for judicial approval, along with murder inquests conducted by the coroner.&nbsp; Those papers for Crawford County which somehow became separated from Quarter Sessions records were presented in the second (1979) volume of <i>Crawford County Genealogy</i> (with a much fuller introduction), accompanied by relevant newspaper articles and estate proceedings.&nbsp; The remaining inquests (through 1875, when the court papers were transferred to the Pennsylvania Archives in Harrisburg) are abstracted here, in chronological order, for the periods <a href="inquest/1804-61.html">1804-1861</a> and <a href="inquest/1862-75.html">1862-1875</a>.<a href="#N2" name="RET2"><font size="-1"><b><sup>2</sup></b></font></a>&nbsp; Citations to the prior compilation have been included, together with probate records from the Orphans Court, which were overlooked.&nbsp; Pertinent cases from Quarter Sessions records (then unavailable) have also been summarized.&nbsp; Only the first inquest is set forth in its entirety; complete transcriptions will appear in the Court of Quarter Sessions records, which are being prepared for this site.</font>
