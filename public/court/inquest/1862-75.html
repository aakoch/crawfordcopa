<blockquote><font size="-1"><i>Crawford Democrat</i> 18 Sept. 1869, p. 3, col. 2:&nbsp; &#147;Probable Murder.&nbsp; [&para] Adam King was an employee of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway company.&nbsp; He resided with his family on the hill immediately west of this city.&nbsp; On Thursday of last week King received his money from the railroad, amounting to about $60.&nbsp; During the afternoon of Thursday he became intoxicated, and remained in that condition until midnight, when he started from a drinking establish¬ment on Dock street for his home. This was late on Thursday night or early Friday morning –there being some discrepancy in the evidence as to the precise hour at which King left his companions.&nbsp; It is rumored that King expressed a fear about passing over the covered bridge which spans the creek at the foot of Dock street.&nbsp; But, be that as it may, it appears the poor man had some reason to entertain fears, for he never saw his family after that fatal afternoon of Thursday.&nbsp; Nothing was seen of King on Friday and Saturday; but on Sabbath morning Mr. T. Patton discovered the body of a man stranded on a sand bar in French creek about two miles south of this place, which was readily identified as that of the missing King.&nbsp; An inquest was held, and the verdict thereof expressed a belief that the deceased had been murdered. This opinion was based upon the following facts, viz:&nbsp; [&para;] 1. Two severe blows had been inflicted upon the head of the deceased—one on the forehead and the other on the top of the skull&#151;neither of which, in the opinion of examining physician, could have occurred from floating in the water. [&para;] 2. No water was found in the lungs of the deceased&#151;a positive proof that respiration could not take place after the body was thrown into the creek. [&para;] 3. Spots of blood were found on the bridge, the third day after the disappearance of King, over which he had necessarily to pass on his way home. [&para;] 4. No money was found upon the person of the deceased.&nbsp; [&para;] In conformity with the rendering of the inquest our City Council offer a reward of $500&#150;and we understand the County Commissioners will offer a similar sum&#150;for information that will lead to the identification and conviction of the murderer or murderers of Adam King.&#148;
