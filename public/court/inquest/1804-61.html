<blockquote><font size="-1"><i>Crawford Journal</i> 1 Nov. 1859, p. 3, col. 1:&nbsp;  &#147;On Wednesdy night last, a German, whose name we could not learn, was drowned near the Aqueduct.&nbsp; It appears that the deceased, with two other men, had come up during the day with a load of wood on a flat boat, to town, and having delivered the wood, got on a &#145;bit of a spree.&#146;&nbsp; In the evening they started for home, and when they got to the Aque-duct, the deceased, who was sitting upon the bow of the boat, considerably intoxicated, fell overboard.&nbsp; His companions stopped the boat and searched for him, but the German could not be found.&nbsp; He was discovered under the flat boat the next morning–and dead, of course. Thus strychnine whisky gets the credit of another untimely death.&nbsp; The deceased man has, we understand, no relatives in this country.&#148;</blockquote></font>
