<dd><i>Note</i>:&nbsp; The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania originally owned all the land in the county, and hence the chain of title to any parcel begins with a deed from the Commonwealth, called a patent.&nbsp; The Patent Books, and indexes, are located at the State Archives in Harrisburg; some of the patents, however, have been copied into the early deed books.&nbsp; A portion of the state was set aside as payment for military services in the Revolutionary War; these are known as the Donation Lands.&nbsp; Much of Donation Districts 6, 7, and 8 fall in Crawford County.&nbsp; Since the county was mostly unsettled (and not yet formed) when the patents to those lands were granted, many soldiers sold their rights to land speculators.&nbsp; Some of their deeds are also recorded in the early deed books, but many are recorded in Allegheny County, from which Crawford was formed in 1800.&nbsp; In fact, any deed to land in Crawford County (other than a patent) recorded before March of 1800 will be found in the first few deed books for Allegheny County.&nbsp; (Those have been microfilmed, but are not yet available in Crawford County other than on loan through the Family History Center).
