<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the miscellaneous indexes shelved in the Office of the Prothonotary is a volume labeled <i>General Index to Habitual Drunkards, No. 1, Crawford County</i>.&nbsp; Sobriety was the subject of 1819 state legislation, which established procedures for examining the competence of any
Pennsylvania resident who &#147;by reason of habitual drunkenness, has become incapable of
managing his or her estate, and is wasting and destroying the same.&#148;<font size="-1"><a name="B1" href="#N1"><sup>1</sup></a></font>&nbsp; Any relation by blood or
marriage<font size="-1"><a name="B2" href="#N2"><sup>2</sup></a></font> could petition the county court of common pleas to appoint a &#147;commissioner&#148; (usually
an attorney)<font size="-1"><a name="B3" href="#N3"><sup>3</sup></a></font> who would summon six or more jurors to hear the testimony of witnesses at an
&#147;inquisition.&#148;<font size="-1"><a name="B4" href="#N4"><sup>4</sup></a></font>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the jury unanimously found the accused to be habitually drunk, the court would appoint a one
or two-person &#147;committee&#148; to act as guardian and trustee of his person and property.<font size="-1"><a name="B5" href="#N5"><sup>5</sup></a></font>&nbsp; The
habitual drunkard could later petition the court to terminate or &quot;supersede&quot; the proceedings by
alleging reformation and habitual sobriety.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>General Index</i> contains only nine entries, and was evidently started about 1877, as additional cases can be found among earlier common pleas and orphans court papers. Abstracted below, inalphabetical order, are all twenty-four known cases of habitual drunkenness commenced during
the nineteenth century.<font size="-1"><a name="B6" href="#N6"><sup>6</sup></a></font>&nbsp; The following four twentieth century cases are listed in the <i>General Index</i>, but not included here:

<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sobriety cases, like lunacy proceedings, are an easily overlooked source of family history.<font size="-1"><a name="B7" href="#N7"><sup>7</sup></a></font>&nbsp; The
reader should remember that not all of the accused were guilty, or afflicted: some were found to
be competent, and others later recovered.&nbsp; Some suits may have been motivated by a desire to
seize a relative's property, or other considerations.&nbsp; Christiana Mackay, for instance, petitioned to
have her husband declared habitually drunk at about the same time that she filed for a divorce--but it was Mr. Mackay who was later awarded a divorce from Christiana.

summer, he had been there about three months; he came to Titusville in August or September and became so badly
intoxicated that it was necessary to return him to the Asylum.&nbsp; <b><a name="1153"></a>M. R. Rouse</b>: I live in the City of Titusville, have known him a number of years; talked with him last evening ate supper with him; he talks as rational and sensible as he ever did
