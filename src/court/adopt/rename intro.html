<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Changing a name, other than by marriage, <a href="../adopt.html" target="_blank">adoption</a>, or <a href="legit intro.html" target=
_blank">legitimation</a>, required an act of the legislature until 1852, when the county Courts of Common Pleas were granted the power to change a person&#146;s name.<sup><a name="n1" href="#FN1">1</a></sup>.&nbsp; The 1852 law was amended in 1859 to clarify that any minor children of an individual whose surname had been changed would also bear the parent&#146;s new surname.<a href="#FN2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A decree from a Common Pleas court became the only method for changing a person&#146;s name after the state Constitution of 1872 abolished name changing by legislative enactment.<a href="#FN3"><sup>3</sup></a>
