<br>RESOLUTION
<br><font size="-1">For the relief of the children of John Augustin Bousquet, deceased.</font></center>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; W<font size="-1">HEREAS</font>, On the eleventh day of January, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and four, J<font size="-1">OHN</font> A<font size="-1">UGUSTIN</font> B<font size="-1">OUSQUET</font>, of the city of Philadelphia, merchant, did present his memorial to the legislature of Pennsylvania, setting forth that he was born in the village of St. Andre, in the department of St. Herautt, in France; came to the United States in September, Anno Domini, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, and being naturalized according to law, he had thereafter resided in the city of Philadelphia, and carried on business extensely [<i>sic</i>] as a merchant.&nbsp; That soon after his arrival in America, he formed a connexion upon principles of affection and confidence with R<font size="-1">EINE</font> M<font size="-1">ARIA</font> E<font size="-1">UGENIA</font> R<font size="-1">ENAUT</font>, who was also a native of France, under an assurance and determination, that as soon as the approbation of his parents would be obtained, the marriage ceremony should sanctify their union.&nbsp; That a variety of circumstances occurred to postpone the accomplishment of this object, during which time, however, the memorialist permitted the said Reine Marie Eugenia Renaut to bear his name.&nbsp; He treated her publicly in all respects as his wife, and became the father of three children, the last of whom proved fatal in its birth to the life of the unfortunate mother.&nbsp; That by the laws which prevailed in France, and which the memorialist imagined were, on this subject, in force in the United States, a natural child is rendered legitimate by the subsequent intermarriage of the parents, and thence arose the procrastination which he then deplored; but, addressing himself to the authority and beneficence of the legislature, he yet hoped to obtain for his offspring a legitimate character in society.&nbsp; That with such view he prayed that a law might be passed, declaring that, for the reasons before stated, his said three children, viz: LOUISA ADELE JOSEPHINA, JOHN MARIA, and JANE MARIA EUGENIA, by the aforesaid Reine Maria Eugenia Renaut, should be entitled to all the rights and benefits of children born in lawful wedlock:&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, A committee of the senate, to whom the said memorial was referred, did report a bill, entitled an act to confer on the natural children of John Augustin Bousquet, the rights and benefits of children born in lawful wedlock, which, on the twentieth of January, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and four, was passed, and ordered to be presented to the house of representatives for concurrence:&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, On the twentieth of February, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and four, the said bill was read a third time before the house, and on the question, whether it should pass, was determined in the negative,&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, It has been communicated to the present legislature of this commonwealth, that the said John Augustin Bousquet died at Bordeaux, in France, on the tenth of September, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, the said three children named in his memorial, surviving him, and residing in the said city, or its environs:&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, It has also been communicated to the present legislature of this commonwealth, that the rejection of the bill of the senate before mentioned, by the house of representatives, in the session of one thousand eight hundred and three, and one thousand eight hundred and four, is prejudicial to the said three children of the memorialist, in these respects:&nbsp; First&mdash;It is not viewed by the tribunals of law in France, that the state of the said three children was left in <i>statu quo prius</i>, the presentation of the said memorial.&nbsp; Secondly&mdash;It is viewed by the said tribunals, that the aforesaid rejection, contained by implication, the opinion of the house, that the said children were illegitimate, and that the said house adopted the inference of the memorialist, upon the state of the facts presented by him to them, as contained in his memorial:&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, It has also been communicated to this legislature, that the aforesaid tribunals will not receive the opinions of the juris-consults, or invoke the tribunals of this commonwealth for information on the subject, and of evidence sufficient to establish a marriage in Pennsylvania, but require a legislative declaration of the consequences to the said parties, of the aforesaid rejection:&nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>,&nbsp; Common justice requires that, under such circumstances, it should be proclaimed that, by such rejection, nothing was intended to be affirmed or denied, of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the said three children, but their legal rights and qualities remained the same precisely after, as before the aforesaid rejection, and that according to the laws and usages of this commonwealth, reputation and co-habitation are sufficient evidence to establish a marriage; and therefore, to render legislative action, as prayed in the said memorial, nugatory.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore,
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; R<font size="-1">ESOLVED</font>,&nbsp; <i>By the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General Assembly met</i>, That the secretary of the commonwealth certify, under his hand and the seal of the state, to all whom it may concern, a copy of the foregoing preamble, as evidence of the law and practice of this commonwealth, upon the subjects hereinbefore recited;&nbsp; <i>Provided however</i>,&nbsp; That nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair the legal rights of creditors, or others, to the property of the said decedent.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, The said George Humphrey Stump and Abraham Harrison Stump have sold and conveyed said tract of land to an innocent purchaser; and the estate of the said Abraham Stump, deceased, has, long since, been finally settled and distributed, in ignorance of the right of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to assess and collect therefrom a collateral inheritance tax:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, Legal proof cannot now be produced of the agreement of marriage, hereinbefore referred to, between the said Abraham Stump and Jane Pearson:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>And whereas</i>, The register of Franklin county aforesaid, has assessed a collateral inheritance tax on said tract of land, amounting to five hundred and twenty-one dollars and twelve cents, ($521&nbsp;12,) together with interest thereon, at the rate of twelve per centum per annum, since the death of the said Abraham Stump, and has instituted legal proceedings in the courts of Franklin county, to collect said tax and the interest thereon; therefore,
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; S<font size="-1">ECTION</font> 1.&nbsp; <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same</i> that from and after the passage of this act, the estate of Abraham Stump, late of Saint Thomas township, Franklin county, Pennsylvania, deceased, is and shall be fully exonerated and discharged from the payment of all collateral inheritance tax, and all the accrued interest thereon, now due and owing to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so that George Humphrey Stump and Abraham Harrison Stump, the sons of said deceased, and all persons claiming under them, or either of them, shall and may, at all times hereafter, have, hold and enjoy said estate, and every part thereof, as fully and completely, freed and exempted from said collateral inheritance tax, to all intents and purposes as if they, the said George Humphrey Stump and Abraham Harrison Stump, had been born in lawful wedlock.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; S<font size="-1">ECTION</font> 2. That all costs and expenses that have accrued and been incurred, in the legal proceedings instituted in the courts of Franklin county, for the collection of said tax, shall be paid by the register of said county, out of the first moneys that shall come into his hands, belonging to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
