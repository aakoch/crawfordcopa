<br>Appeal of Hattie Peterson &#147;From a decree dismissing exceptions to an auditor&#146;s report,&#148; published at <i>In re Peterson&#146;s Estate</i>, 212 Pa. 453, 61 A. 1005 (1905):
<blockquote>
This case seems to have been argued and adjudged in the court below on the view that the only essential and governing fact on the question of adoption is the literal decree of the court. This is an error. The cardinal fact is the intent of the adopting parent. The court has a veto power, to refuse to sanction the adoption unless satisfied that the welfare of the child will be promoted by it; but beyond that its action is only confirmatory of the action of the parent, of which, in the language of the statute, &#145;the record of the court shall be sufficient evidence.&#146; No action by any court appears to be absolutely essential to a valid and lawful adoption. The act of April 2, 1872 (P. L. 31), recognizes adoption by deed, and provides for the recording of the deed and a certified copy as evidence. Ballard v. Ward, 89 Pa. 358. The more convenient system under the act of 1855, now supplied by the amended act of May 19, 1887 (P. L. 125), provides for the approval of the judge, and the decree of the court is made the statutory evidence of a fully formed and executed intent on the part of the adopting parent, just as, in the analogous case of a will, where the intent is the cardinal fact, the law requires that it be signed at the end thereof as the statutory evidence that the intent is complete and executed. In the present case the decree is ambiguous, in that it uses both singular and plural in reference to the petition, &#145;And now, January 15, 1872, upon the petition of Samuel Peterson, and it appearing that Hattie Nickerson, the child therein mentioned, has been supported by the petitioner for one and half years past, and the court, being satisfied on due consideration that the welfare of the said Hattie Nickerson will be promoted by the adoption as the child and one of the heirs of the petitioners, with the consent of the directors of the poor of said county, decree that the said child shall assume the name of Hattie Peterson, and have all the rights of a child and heir of said Samuel Peterson, and be subject to the duties of a child.&#146; Turning, now, to the petition, we find that Samuel Peterson is named first as the sole petitioner, but the prayer is for a decree that the child may assume the name of Hattie Peterson and &#145;have all the rights of a child and heir of the petitioners&#146; (in the plural), and the petition is signed by both Samuel and Laura Peterson. How all this came about is explained by the counsel in the case, from whose testimony it appears that the petition was drawn originally in the name of the husband, and after presentation to the court the wife came in at the suggestion of the judge, and then the petition and decree already prepared were changed to conform to the changed application, but the change was made with such want of completeness as to create the ambiguity.
[&#182;] 
How far the ambiguity in the decree may be considered latent, so as to admit this parol evidence, may be open to doubt; but we may disregard such evidence entirely and still have no difficulty. The petition is the act of both husband and wife. Both signed it before the court passed upon it, and &#145;mala grammatica non vitiat chartam.&#146; A paper, though drawn in the name of one, is presumed to be the act of all who sign it, and therefore, when Laura Peterson signed the petition, it must be presumed that she intended to make herself party to it, and this presumption is reinforced by the prayer that the adopted child shall have &#145;all the rights of a child and heir of the petitioners.&#146; On the face of the record, therefore, Laura Peterson was a party to the adoption, and, if we look into the parol testimony as to her actual intent, there is demonstration that it was not only her intention at the time to do it, but her unquestioning belief through a long subsequent life that she had done so. A similar careful examination of the decree leads to the same conclusion. The recital of the petition as that of Samuel Peterson, and of the support of the child by the petitioner, is in the singular; but the next clause, which expresses the decision of the court on the essential point which its judicial duty was to consider, is in the plural&#145;the court, being satisfied on due consideration that the welfare of the said Hattie Nickerson will be promoted by the adoption as the child and one of the heirs of the petitioners,&#146; etc.
[&#182;] 
Where ambiguity is introduced into a writing by verbal changes, which either should have been made in additional places or not made at all, the presumption in favor of the validity of affirmative action should prevail. In other words, as applicable to this case, it is more probable, as shown by experience, and therefore to be presumed, that the hand that made the alterations in the papers made fewer of them than he should have made to express his full purpose than that those he did make were accidental or unintended. In every view the appellant&#146;s case was clear.
[&#182;] 
Decree reversed. Petition and all subsequent proceedings directed to be dismissed, at the cost of the appellees.

<blockquote>[Letter in file:]&nbsp; &#147;No 5111 Aldama St., Los Angeles, California&nbsp; Jan. 4 &ndash; 1939.&nbsp; To Register of Records, City of Meadville, Crawford Co. Pa.&nbsp; My dear Sir, &ndash; I am desirous of obtaining the Date, and Year of my Birth and also the Record of my adoption, in the city of Meadville, Crawford County, Pa.&nbsp; I was a child of adoption by Samuel Peterson, and his wife Laura Peterson, whose house was located on Park Avenue (number not known) City of Meadville. [&#182;] My own mother&#146;s name was, Mrs. Anne Nickerson, (My name Hattie Nickerson) Parents parted.&nbsp; Adoption took place in January 1872.&nbsp; I assumed the name Peterson at that time.&nbsp; Myron Park Davis Atty., who was afterwards my attorney for a case, told me he drew up the adoption papers.&nbsp; I merely speak of this thinking it might be of help to you in case his records are still on file, as he died some years ago.&nbsp; I have not got a record of my birth, or adoption but was told by Foster Parents I was born March 25, 1869.&nbsp; Have gone by that statement ever since.&nbsp; But I have applied for Old Age Pension in California, (Los Angeles County) and it seems necessary that I have those records if possible, there are so many people here who are trying to take advantage in various ways.&nbsp; I was advised, &#145;To write to the place of my birth and see if I could find anything definite&#146; [&#182;] So if you can find any records on the matter and kindly send them to me, and also include Fee for your efforts, It will be gratefully received. [&#182;] Thanking you in advance. [&#182;] I am Yours Truly, Miss Harriett G. Peterson[,] 5111 Aldama Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles, California.&nbsp; [on reverse:]&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Have chosen name Harriett G. Peterson in preference to nickname Hattie.&nbsp; An attorney told me I had a right to do so if I preferred the former so I sign all papers by that name.&nbsp; But the name Hattie was given in adoption papers. [&#162;] Sincerely&nbsp; Harriett G. Peterson.

<br> [Carbon copy of letter typed on Prothonotary&#146;s stationery, dated at Meadville 10 Jan. 1939, addressed to Miss Harriet G. Peterson, 5111 Aldama Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles, Calif.:]&nbsp; &#147;My dear Madam:&nbsp; Your letter of 4th instant, addressed to &#145;Register of Records&#146; has finally been delivered to me, as adoptions were in this Court up to 1925, and there being no such office as register of records. [&#182;] First, There were no [two words interlined] birth records in Pennsylvania until 1893,-except in a few of the cities. [&#182;] Second, I find that one Hattie Nickerson was adopted by decree of this court dated Jan. 15, 1872, as the child and heir of Samuel Peterson, and her name changed to Hattie Peterson. [&#182;] Third, in the year 1901, in the matter of the estate of Laura Peterson, No. 5 Sept. term, 1901, in the Orphans Court of this county, it appears that the question came up as to whether Hattie Peterson was also the heir of Laura Peterson.&nbsp; Our court decided that she was not, because of the omission of the name of the wife, Laura Peterson from the decree of adoption, although Laura Peterson had signed the petition.&nbsp; the case appealed to the Supreme Court of Penn&#146;a, and the decree was reversed. [&#182;] Fourth, the petition for adoption which was sworn to on January 9, 1872, sets forth that &#145;the child is about three years of age. [&#182;] Fifth, the petition also sets forth that Hattie was the child of Ann Nickerson, and that petitioner had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the child&#146;s parents, and believe her to be abandoned. [&#182;] If you desire a record of the adoption proceedings in this court I will make samem [<i>sic</i>] duly certified under Act of Congress on receipt of &#36;3.00.&nbsp; My fees for searches, etc. is &#36;1.00, which please remit.&nbsp; Yours very truly, Paul D. Slayton, Prothonotary.&#148;</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Enclosed letter typed on Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company stationery:]&nbsp; &#147;Office of Trainmaster, Durand, Michigan, Jan. 9, 1939 [addressed to] Probate Court&nbsp Crawford County, Meadville, Penna. [&#182;] Dear Sir: [&#182;] Our employee, James Frederick Page, now living at 932 Lomita Avenue, Flint, and engaged as a Switchman, is being required to furnish birth certificate or satisfactory proof of age, and in conversation with I have learned the following facts; [&#182;] He was born November 1, 1889 at Oil City, Venango County, Pennsylvania and was adopted by Louis and Almia Page, when about four years of age.&nbsp; Adoption papers were filed through the Court of Crawford County, and he has no knowledge of his original name or history. [&#182;] It is necessary that we have something definite from the State of Pennsylvania, also the County of Venango as to any registration of birth (after we have developed his original name) or a copy of the adoption papers, if in order.&nbsp; If it is not in order for the Court to furnish this information, a letter or affidavit indicating what the adoption records show as to his name and date of birth, together with information as to date of adoption, will suffice. [&#182;] I am writing this letter for Mr. Page and you may reply to me direct, or to our employee at his home address &ndash; 928 Lomita Avenue, Flint, Michigan. [&#182;] Yours Sincerely,&#148; signed G A Briggs, Trainmaster.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Attached letter from Paul D. Slayton, Prothonotary, addressed to Mr. G. A. Briggs:] &#147; &#8230; I can find no adoption of a child of that name by Louis and Alma Page indexed in our records.&nbsp; However, I find that F. L. Page of Bloomfied Township (about 20 miles N.E. of Meadville) adopted one James Milliman, child of George and Harriet Milliman, on Sept. 14, 1891.&nbsp; The petition sets forth that the child was then about four years old.&nbsp; Quite likely this is an other person [!?!].&#148;</blockquote>

In reference to the adoption of Florence Chronaberry, the three year old daughter of James Chronaberry. [&#182;] You wish to know what character of man the father is.&nbsp; I would state that he does not bear a very good reputation in this community.&nbsp; On May 13, 1911, there was an application filed in this Court, declaring Edna Chronaberry, a daughter of the said James Chronaberry, a dependent and neglected child.&nbsp; I found the allegation in the affidavit true, and sent the girl to the Knoop&#146;s Children&#146;s Home in this county.&nbsp; The evidence at that time showed that the father was running with vicious persons, and neglected to supply the proper means of support for his children.&nbsp; Later he called at this office and made an application to act as Administrator for the estate of his wife. This application I positively refuse, thinking he was not a fit person for that trust. [&#182;] I would say that if Florence Chronaberry can be adopted by Albert Cromes, who I understand is a respectable person, she will be fortunate.
