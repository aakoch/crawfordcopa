The accident occurred in Lake Erie, and the body was recovered, and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has approved claim for payment in amount &#36;10,000.00 and under the settlement plan arranged by the insured for the beneficiary, we require a record of the date of birth of the beneficiary, who, in this case is Marie A. Taylor, the child that was adopted by the Ellison&#146;s.&nbsp; The adoption papers that we have before us does not indicate the age of the child or the date of birth.&nbsp; We need this information, and we are endeavoring to assist Mrs. Taylor in securing this data. In fact she has requested our Assistant Manager Wolford to help her as much as possible. &nbsp; Will you, therefore, examine the records, to see if you can give us any definite information regarding the date of birth of this child, Marie Angeline McCollum, or the age at time of adoption by the Ellison&#146;s?

[&#182;] I do not know where these particular Ellisons lived at the time, although there were some Ellisons living at Townville about that time.&nbsp; From the fact that the petition is endorsed with the names of Trax &amp; Parker, Attorneys, Oil City, Pa., the child might have been born in Venango County.&nbsp; The petition and consent of the natural parents were both sworn to before an Alderman of the City of Titusville, this County.&nbsp; A memorandum on the petition indicates that the decree was &#145;issued to Byles,&#146; which would be Axtell J. Byles, Esq., then practicing in Titusville, Pa., now in the City of New York.&mdash;I think he is the President of the American Oil Institute. [&#182;] Would suggest that you write to J. D.

In reference to the adoption of Florence Chronaberry, the three year old daughter of James Chronaberry. [&#182;] You wish to know what character of man the father is.&nbsp; I would state that he does not bear a very good reputation in this community.&nbsp; On May 13, 1911, there was an application filed in this Court, declaring Edna Chronaberry, a daughter of the said James Chronaberry, a dependent and neglected child.&nbsp; I found the allegation in the affidavit true, and sent the girl to the Knoop&#146;s Children&#146;s Home in this county.&nbsp; The evidence at that time showed that the father was running with vicious persons, and neglected to supply the proper means of support for his children.&nbsp; Later he called at this office and made an application to act as Administrator for the estate of his wife. This application I positively refuse, thinking he was not a fit person for that trust. [&#182;] I would say that if Florence Chronaberry can be adopted by Albert Cromes, who I understand is a respectable person, she will be fortunate.
