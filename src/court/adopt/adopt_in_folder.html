<br>Appeal of Hattie Peterson &#147;From a decree dismissing exceptions to an auditor&#146;s report,&#148; published at <i>In re Peterson&#146;s Estate</i>, 212 Pa. 453, 61 A. 1005 (1905):
<blockquote>
This case seems to have been argued and adjudged in the court below on the view that the only essential and governing fact on the question of adoption is the literal decree of the court. This is an error. The cardinal fact is the intent of the adopting parent. The court has a veto power, to refuse to sanction the adoption unless satisfied that the welfare of the child will be promoted by it; but beyond that its action is only confirmatory of the action of the parent, of which, in the language of the statute, &#145;the record of the court shall be sufficient evidence.&#146; No action by any court appears to be absolutely essential to a valid and lawful adoption. The act of April 2, 1872 (P. L. 31), recognizes adoption by deed, and provides for the recording of the deed and a certified copy as evidence. Ballard v. Ward, 89 Pa. 358. The more convenient system under the act of 1855, now supplied by the amended act of May 19, 1887 (P. L. 125), provides for the approval of the judge, and the decree of the court is made the statutory evidence of a fully formed and executed intent on the part of the adopting parent, just as, in the analogous case of a will, where the intent is the cardinal fact, the law requires that it be signed at the end thereof as the statutory evidence that the intent is complete and executed. In the present case the decree is ambiguous, in that it uses both singular and plural in reference to the petition, &#145;And now, January 15, 1872, upon the petition of Samuel Peterson, and it appearing that Hattie Nickerson, the child therein mentioned, has been supported by the petitioner for one and half years past, and the court, being satisfied on due consideration that the welfare of the said Hattie Nickerson will be promoted by the adoption as the child and one of the heirs of the petitioners, with the consent of the directors of the poor of said county, decree that the said child shall assume the name of Hattie Peterson, and have all the rights of a child and heir of said Samuel Peterson, and be subject to the duties of a child.&#146; Turning, now, to the petition, we find that Samuel Peterson is named first as the sole petitioner, but the prayer is for a decree that the child may assume the name of Hattie Peterson and &#145;have all the rights of a child and heir of the petitioners&#146; (in the plural), and the petition is signed by both Samuel and Laura Peterson. How all this came about is explained by the counsel in the case, from whose testimony it appears that the petition was drawn originally in the name of the husband, and after presentation to the court the wife came in at the suggestion of the judge, and then the petition and decree already prepared were changed to conform to the changed application, but the change was made with such want of completeness as to create the ambiguity.
[&#182;] 
How far the ambiguity in the decree may be considered latent, so as to admit this parol evidence, may be open to doubt; but we may disregard such evidence entirely and still have no difficulty. The petition is the act of both husband and wife. Both signed it before the court passed upon it, and &#145;mala grammatica non vitiat chartam.&#146; A paper, though drawn in the name of one, is presumed to be the act of all who sign it, and therefore, when Laura Peterson signed the petition, it must be presumed that she intended to make herself party to it, and this presumption is reinforced by the prayer that the adopted child shall have &#145;all the rights of a child and heir of the petitioners.&#146; On the face of the record, therefore, Laura Peterson was a party to the adoption, and, if we look into the parol testimony as to her actual intent, there is demonstration that it was not only her intention at the time to do it, but her unquestioning belief through a long subsequent life that she had done so. A similar careful examination of the decree leads to the same conclusion. The recital of the petition as that of Samuel Peterson, and of the support of the child by the petitioner, is in the singular; but the next clause, which expresses the decision of the court on the essential point which its judicial duty was to consider, is in the plural&#145;the court, being satisfied on due consideration that the welfare of the said Hattie Nickerson will be promoted by the adoption as the child and one of the heirs of the petitioners,&#146; etc.
[&#182;] 
Where ambiguity is introduced into a writing by verbal changes, which either should have been made in additional places or not made at all, the presumption in favor of the validity of affirmative action should prevail. In other words, as applicable to this case, it is more probable, as shown by experience, and therefore to be presumed, that the hand that made the alterations in the papers made fewer of them than he should have made to express his full purpose than that those he did make were accidental or unintended. In every view the appellant&#146;s case was clear.
[&#182;] 
Decree reversed. Petition and all subsequent proceedings directed to be dismissed, at the cost of the appellees.

<blockquote>[Letter in file:]&nbsp; &#147;No 5111 Aldama St., Los Angeles, California&nbsp; Jan. 4 &ndash; 1939.&nbsp; To Register of Records, City of Meadville, Crawford Co. Pa.&nbsp; My dear Sir, &ndash; I am desirous of obtaining the Date, and Year of my Birth and also the Record of my adoption, in the city of Meadville, Crawford County, Pa.&nbsp; I was a child of adoption by Samuel Peterson, and his wife Laura Peterson, whose house was located on Park Avenue (number not known) City of Meadville. [&#182;] My own mother&#146;s name was, Mrs. Anne Nickerson, (My name Hattie Nickerson) Parents parted.&nbsp; Adoption took place in January 1872.&nbsp; I assumed the name Peterson at that time.&nbsp; Myron Park Davis Atty., who was afterwards my attorney for a case, told me he drew up the adoption papers.&nbsp; I merely speak of this thinking it might be of help to you in case his records are still on file, as he died some years ago.&nbsp; I have not got a record of my birth, or adoption but was told by Foster Parents I was born March 25, 1869.&nbsp; Have gone by that statement ever since.&nbsp; But I have applied for Old Age Pension in California, (Los Angeles County) and it seems necessary that I have those records if possible, there are so many people here who are trying to take advantage in various ways.&nbsp; I was advised, &#145;To write to the place of my birth and see if I could find anything definite&#146; [&#182;] So if you can find any records on the matter and kindly send them to me, and also include Fee for your efforts, It will be gratefully received. [&#182;] Thanking you in advance. [&#182;] I am Yours Truly, Miss Harriett G. Peterson[,] 5111 Aldama Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles, California.&nbsp; [on reverse:]&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Have chosen name Harriett G. Peterson in preference to nickname Hattie.&nbsp; An attorney told me I had a right to do so if I preferred the former so I sign all papers by that name.&nbsp; But the name Hattie was given in adoption papers. [&#162;] Sincerely&nbsp; Harriett G. Peterson.

<br> [Carbon copy of letter typed on Prothonotary&#146;s stationery, dated at Meadville 10 Jan. 1939, addressed to Miss Harriet G. Peterson, 5111 Aldama Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles, Calif.:]&nbsp; &#147;My dear Madam:&nbsp; Your letter of 4th instant, addressed to &#145;Register of Records&#146; has finally been delivered to me, as adoptions were in this Court up to 1925, and there being no such office as register of records. [&#182;] First, There were no [two words interlined] birth records in Pennsylvania until 1893,-except in a few of the cities. [&#182;] Second, I find that one Hattie Nickerson was adopted by decree of this court dated Jan. 15, 1872, as the child and heir of Samuel Peterson, and her name changed to Hattie Peterson. [&#182;] Third, in the year 1901, in the matter of the estate of Laura Peterson, No. 5 Sept. term, 1901, in the Orphans Court of this county, it appears that the question came up as to whether Hattie Peterson was also the heir of Laura Peterson.&nbsp; Our court decided that she was not, because of the omission of the name of the wife, Laura Peterson from the decree of adoption, although Laura Peterson had signed the petition.&nbsp; the case appealed to the Supreme Court of Penn&#146;a, and the decree was reversed. [&#182;] Fourth, the petition for adoption which was sworn to on January 9, 1872, sets forth that &#145;the child is about three years of age. [&#182;] Fifth, the petition also sets forth that Hattie was the child of Ann Nickerson, and that petitioner had no knowledge of the whereabouts of the child&#146;s parents, and believe her to be abandoned. [&#182;] If you desire a record of the adoption proceedings in this court I will make samem [<i>sic</i>] duly certified under Act of Congress on receipt of &#36;3.00.&nbsp; My fees for searches, etc. is &#36;1.00, which please remit.&nbsp; Yours very truly, Paul D. Slayton, Prothonotary.&#148;</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Enclosed letter typed on Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company stationery:]&nbsp; &#147;Office of Trainmaster, Durand, Michigan, Jan. 9, 1939 [addressed to] Probate Court&nbsp Crawford County, Meadville, Penna. [&#182;] Dear Sir: [&#182;] Our employee, James Frederick Page, now living at 932 Lomita Avenue, Flint, and engaged as a Switchman, is being required to furnish birth certificate or satisfactory proof of age, and in conversation with I have learned the following facts; [&#182;] He was born November 1, 1889 at Oil City, Venango County, Pennsylvania and was adopted by Louis and Almia Page, when about four years of age.&nbsp; Adoption papers were filed through the Court of Crawford County, and he has no knowledge of his original name or history. [&#182;] It is necessary that we have something definite from the State of Pennsylvania, also the County of Venango as to any registration of birth (after we have developed his original name) or a copy of the adoption papers, if in order.&nbsp; If it is not in order for the Court to furnish this information, a letter or affidavit indicating what the adoption records show as to his name and date of birth, together with information as to date of adoption, will suffice. [&#182;] I am writing this letter for Mr. Page and you may reply to me direct, or to our employee at his home address &ndash; 928 Lomita Avenue, Flint, Michigan. [&#182;] Yours Sincerely,&#148; signed G A Briggs, Trainmaster.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Attached letter from Paul D. Slayton, Prothonotary, addressed to Mr. G. A. Briggs:] &#147; &#8230; I can find no adoption of a child of that name by Louis and Alma Page indexed in our records.&nbsp; However, I find that F. L. Page of Bloomfied Township (about 20 miles N.E. of Meadville) adopted one James Milliman, child of George and Harriet Milliman, on Sept. 14, 1891.&nbsp; The petition sets forth that the child was then about four years old.&nbsp; Quite likely this is an other person [!?!].&#148;</blockquote>

In reference to the adoption of Florence Chronaberry, the three year old daughter of James Chronaberry. [&#182;] You wish to know what character of man the father is.&nbsp; I would state that he does not bear a very good reputation in this community.&nbsp; On May 13, 1911, there was an application filed in this Court, declaring Edna Chronaberry, a daughter of the said James Chronaberry, a dependent and neglected child.&nbsp; I found the allegation in the affidavit true, and sent the girl to the Knoop&#146;s Children&#146;s Home in this county.&nbsp; The evidence at that time showed that the father was running with vicious persons, and neglected to supply the proper means of support for his children.&nbsp; Later he called at this office and made an application to act as Administrator for the estate of his wife. This application I positively refuse, thinking he was not a fit person for that trust. [&#182;] I would say that if Florence Chronaberry can be adopted by Albert Cromes, who I understand is a respectable person, she will be fortunate.

There is some information I have been able to find out through various sources. However I must have a birth certificate in order to obtain a passport for areas I plan to visit and in a few years will need it for Social Security benefits.

I lived in Meadville & was baptized in the Congregational Church (they have no record of birth place either) on Park Avenue until I was eight or nine years old.&nbsp; 8.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [(Typed) &#147;Motion to quash and dismiss the Petition&#148;:]&nbsp; &#147;Now Dec. <u>1</u><font size="-1"><sup><u>st</u></sup></font>, <strike>1916</strike> 1918 [date and year handwritten], comes James R. Hannah, a resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania and sole surviving grand-parent of the above named minor children, Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, by C. Victor Johnson, Esq., and O. Clare Kent, Esq., and objects to the granting of the prayer of the petitioner in this case and respectfully moves the Court to quash and dismiss the said petition filed, and assigns the following reasons in support thereof:&mdash; [&#182] First:&ndash; That James R. Hannah, resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, is the sole surviving grandparent of the said named minor children; he being the paternal grand-father, the paternal grand-mother and both maternal grand parents having died before the death of the parents of the said named minor children. [&#182;] Second:&ndash; That legally, James R. Hannah is the nearest next of kin to the said children and by lines of consanguinity and affinity their nearest surviving relative, which ipso facto makes him the legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of said minor children and the proper and legal person to give consent to the proposed adoption. [&#182;] Third:&ndash; That before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition, filed in this case, it is necessary, under the requirements of the Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth, relating to the adoption of children, to-wit, the Acts of 1855, P.L. 430, of 1887, P.L. 125, P.L. 380, that the petition must contain, as a part thereof, the written consent of the legal and recognized next friend of the child or children sought to be adopted; which in this case is James R. Hannah, their paternal grand-father, who hereby objects to the proposed adoption of the said named children and witholds [<i>sic</i>] his consent thereto. [&#182;] Fourth:&ndash; That the Court has no power, authority or jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because Herman A. Williams, a maternal uncle of said children, is not the legally authorized and recognized next friend or person clothed with the legal authority and right to give consent to the said proposed adoption. [&#182;] Fifth:&ndash; That the Court has no power, authority or jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because the Overseers of the Poor of Crawford County, to-wit, H.C. Wasson and A. E. Lilly, have no legal authority, right or standing to give their consent to the proposed adoption; the said named children, sought to be adopted, never having become a charge upon the said County of Crawford and they having a paternal grand-father in full life and of sufficient ability to relieve and maintain them as is required by the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, viz:&ndash; The Act of June 13th, 1836 P.L. 539. [&#182;] Sixth:&ndash; The Court is also moved to enter an order in the said stated case, permitting and allowing a reasonable and sufficient time for the filing of an answer to the petition filed, after the final disposition of this Motion to Quash, if it is the opinion of the Honorable Court that this motion should be dismissed and an answer to the petition as filed be required.&nbsp; And he will ever pray &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed O. Clare Kent, C. Victor Johnson, &#147;Attorneys for James R. Hannah.&#148;&nbsp; Sworn to and subscribed James. R. Hannah before V. L. Greeley, Prothonotary, 29 Nov. 1919.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [(Typed) Opinion and Order of Prather, President Judge, &#147;Sur Demurrer to Petition,&#148; filed 15 Dec. 1919:]&nbsp; &#147;The children named are the minor children of Glen and Harriet Hannah, deceased.&nbsp; The only surviving grandparent is James S. Hannah.&nbsp; The Petition for adoption has the consent of the Overseers of the Poor and a maternal uncle as next friend, joining in the prayer. [&#182;] The Act of 1887, P. L.125, amending Sec. 7 of the Act of 1856, P. L. 430, and its amendment dated May 28, 1915, P. O. 580, prescribe the jurisdictional requisites of such petition.&nbsp; Bearing in mind that the father and mother are both dead, so much of Sec. 7 of said act as is applicable to the present contention reads: [&#182;, indented] &#145;The Court may with the consent of the next friend of such child, or the guardians or overseers of the poor, or of such charitable institution as shall have supported such child for at least one year, decree&#146, etc. [&#182;] The question raised by the demurrer is whether the parties consenting to such adoption come within the statutes as &#145;next friend&#146; or as consent<strike>i</strike>able parties. [&#182;] As the proceeding is statutory, all the authorities agree that &#145;Its requirements must be followed in order to give the Court jurisdiction&#146;. [&#182;, indented] Keeler&#146;s Adoption, 52 S.C. 516. [next line] Vandermis vs Gilbert, 10 S. C., 570. [&#182;] It is contended that the statutory requirements are met in this case by obtaining the consent of the Overseers of the Poor.&nbsp; The logic of this contention is that the legislature meant that either the next friend, or the &#145;guardians or overseers of the poor&#146; stood in an equal consent[<strike>i</strike>able relation to the proceeding; hence the petitioner could exercise his option to secure either. [&#182;] The language taken alone might fairly warrant this interpretation, but considering the entire section and the far reaching consequences of the decree, reason as well as authority seems to require a different conclusion.&nbsp; Minor orphans having property are no more likely to become a charge upon the overseers of the poor than are minors with parents who have no property.&nbsp; In fact, such parents with their children may become a charge upon such overseers, and more probably so than the orphaned minors with property.&nbsp; Hence, unless such responsibility of maintenance has fallen upon the county or the probability of its doing so is manifest from the pleadings, the intervention of such overseers, though well meant, would seem presumptuous. [&#182;] This conclusion is the more apparent when we consider that the Act of 1915 makes such an adopting parent heir of the adopted child as though a natural parent.&nbsp; The result of such a decree in many instances would change the line of inheritance and divert inheritable property by descent to strangers who otherwise would be but aliens to the estate. [&#182;, indented] See Booth vs Van Allen, 7 Phila, 401. [next line] In re Reuben H. Davis, 13 D. R., 688. [&#182;] The question presented does not seem to have been ruled upon by the appellate courts of our State.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Iowa, in Holmes vs. Derrig, 103 N. W., 973, in passing upon the Iowa statute quite similar to our own, held that when the father and mother of a child are both dead, the grandparents were the &#145;next of kin&#146;, and that the consent of a grandparent was a prerequisite to a decree of adoption. [&#182;, indented] See in Benton, 80 N. W. (Iowa) 614. [&#182;] Under the facts a maternal uncle is not the &#145;next of kin&#146; within the meaning of the statute.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Separate (typed) &#147;Protest of James R. Hannah to Adoption, and Demurrer to Petition,&#148;:]&nbsp; &#147;Now Dec. 30<font size="-1"><sup><u>th</u></sup></font>, 1921 [day handwritten], comes James R. Hannah, a resident of the City of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, and sole surviving grand parent of the above named minor children, Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, by C. Vicgor [<i>sic</i>] Johnson and O. Clare Kent, his attorneys, and objects to the granting of the prayer of the petitioner in this case, and respectfully moves the Court to quash and dismiss the said petition, and assigns the following reasons in support thereof: [&#182] 1st: That James R. Hannah, a resident of the city of Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, is the sole surviving grand-parent of the said named minor children, he being the paternal grand-father, the paternal grand-mother and both maternal grand-parents having died before the death of the parents of the said named minor children. [&#182;] 2nd: That legally James R. Hannah is the nearest next of kin to the said children, and by lines of consanguinity and affinity their nearest surviving relative, which, <u>ipso facto</u>, makes him the legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of the said minor children, and the proper and lawful person to give consent to the proposed adoption. [&#182;] 3rd: That before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition filed in this case, it is necessary, under the requirements of the acts of assembly of this commonwealth, relating to the adoption of children, to-wit, the Act of 1855, PL 430, the act of 1887, PL 125, and the act of 1915, PL 580, that the petition must contain as a part thereof, the written consent of the legal and recognized next friend of the child or children sought to be adopted, which in this case is James R. Hannah, their paternal grand-father, who hereby objects to the proposed adoption of the said named children and withholds his consent thereto. [&#182;] 4th: That the court has no jurisdiction, authority, or power to entertain the petition filed in this case, because Edward L. Williams, a maternal uncle of said children and a non-resident of the state of Pennsylvania, and J. P. Williams, a grand-uncle of said children, are not the legally authorized and recognized next friends or persons clothed with the legal authority and right to give consent to the said proposed adoption. [&#182;] 5th: That the questions and matters involved in this proceeding are, res ajudicata, the same having been presented to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, upon petition of Charles L. Shaw and Margaret W. Shaw, filed at No. <a href="#192002020">20 February Term 1920</a>, and praying for a decree of adoption for the said Charles G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, minor children of J. Glenn Hannah and Harriet B. Hannah, deceased, which said petition, demurrer thereto, and the action of the court thereon are as follows: [entire proceedings therein transcribed, but omitted here]. [&#182;] 6th: That since the disposition by this Honorable Court on the former application for the adoption of these same children by the same petitioners, the said child, Charles G. Hannah has been placed, together with his two brothers, James A. Hannah and John E. Hannah, in the Odd Fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pennsylvania, to-wit, on the 7th day of April, 1920, by Crawford Lodge No. 734, of Meadville, Pa., of which said Lodge the deceased father was a member, in compliance with a request of the deceased parents of said children made shortly before their deaths, and since which time said children have been kept and maintained by the said Orphan&#146;s Home, excepting that the said James R. Hannah, protestant, has contributed much, if not all, of their clothing, as well as money and other things, and articles for their comfort and maintenance, and the protestant now submits and contends that it would not be for the best interest of said child, Charles G. Hannah, to remove him therefrom and from the society and association of his two brothers. [&#182;] 7th: That the said child, Charles G. Hannah, has been supported in the Odd Fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pa., a charitable institution, for more than one year prior to the filing of the petition in this case, and that before the court can entertain jurisdiction thereof, the consent of the guardians or overseers of said Institution must be obtained, as required by the acts of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in such cases made and provided. [&#182;] 8th: That the protestant, James R. Hannah, the paternal grandfather of said children, is now, and since the death of their parents has been greatly interested in the welfare of said children, has contributed toward their support, maintenance and comfort, and will continue such contributions in the future. That said children possess individual estates in the hands of their guardian, the New First National Bank of Meadville, Pa., inherited from their parents, and a portion of which has been contributed by the said protestant, and that a decree of adoption in this case prayed for, would change the line of inheritance, and might divert inheritable property by descent to strangers who otherwise would be aliens to the estate. [&#182;] 9th: That the said petitioners, Charles L. Shaw and Margaret F. Shaw are not fit, proper and suitable persons to be given the care, custody, control, raising and training of said minor children, and that a decree of adoption in this case would not be for the best interests of the said minor child. [&#182;] 10th: Wherefore, the Court is respectfully moved to enter an order in the said stated case, quashing and dismissing the petition filed herein. [&#182;] And he will ever pray, &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed C. Victor Johnson, O. Clare Kent, Attorneys for James R. Hannah; sworn to by James R. Hannah and subscribed J. R. Hannah before V. L.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Separate (typed) response, described on cover in handwriting as &#147;Answer of Petitioners for adoption, to Protest of James R. Hannah against, and Motion to Dismiss Petition for, adoption,&#148;:]&nbsp; &#147;Now, December 8, 1921 [with &#145;8&#146; handwritten], Come Charles L. Shaw and Margaret W. Shaw, the petitioners in the above captioned case, by John O. McClintock and Walter J. McClintock, their Attorneys, and in answer to the protest of James R. Hannah against the granting of the petition of the petitioners for the adoption of said minor children, and his motion to dismiss said petition heretofore filed, respectfully say:- [&#182;] 1. The petitioners admit that the said James R. Hannah is now the only surviving grandparent of the minor children for whose adoption the petition in this case was filed, but he was not the only surviving grandparent of said children at the time of the death of their parents, their grandparent Alfred D. Williams, then being alive, whose death has since occurred. [&#182;] 2. They deny that the said James R. Hannah is the only next of kin of the said children, and that he is the only legal and recognized next friend and natural guardian of said children, and the only proper and lawful person to give consent to the proposed adoption, and aver that the said children have for next of kin and for next friends, three uncles, brothers of their deceased mother, namely: Herman A. Williams, John L. Williams and Edward L. Williams, one granduncle, John P. Williams, and one aunt, sister of the deceased mother of said children, Margaret W. Shaw, all of whom are next friends of said minor children, and are proper persons to give consent to the adoption of said minor children. [&#182;] 3. They deny that before the court can entertain jurisdiction of the petition filed in this case it is necessary under the requirements of the Act of Assembly of May 28, 1915, relating to adoption, under which this proceeding was instituted, that the petition must contain as a part thereof the written consent of James R. Hannah, their paternal grandfather, but aver t [next line] that they have attached to their petition the written consent to the adoption of said children by the petitioners of Edward L. Williams, an uncle of said children, and the written consent of John P. Williams, a grand-uncle of said children, as next friends of said children, who are interested in the welfare of said children to such an extent as to see that proper persons are interested with their rearing, which written consents are a full compliance with the requirements of the Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth relative to adoption, and therefore the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition in this case. [&#182;] 4. They deny the allegations of the protestant that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed in this case because Edward L. Williams, a maternal uncle, and John P. Williams, a grand-uncle, of said children are the legally authorized [next two words carreted] and recognized next friends or persons clothed with legal authority and right to give consent to said proposed adoption, and aver that the consent given by said uncle and grand-uncle is the consent of the next friend contemplated by the Act of Assembly relating to adoption proceedings, as adjudged by law. [&#182;] 5. They deny that the questions involved in this proceeding are res adjudicata. They admit that the proceedings mentioned in the protestant&#146;s petition as having been before and passed upon by this court at <a href="#192002020">No. 20 February Term 1920</a>, were had and that the petition in said case was dismissed on December 18, 1919, but they aver that since the order of dismissal of the said petition was made the question involved has been passed upon by the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by a decision handed down July 14, 1920, and the law bearing upon the question involved in said case has been declared to be contrary to the <strike>decision</strike> <strike>in</strike> <strike>the</strike> conclusion reached by the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County above mentioned, <strike>w</strike> [next line] wherein said appellate court declared that &#145;on a petition for the adoption of two children, the consent of a grand-uncle as next friend is a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the acts of assembly relative to adoption, and this is the case, even although the grandparents of the children are living&#146;, Wherefore, the petitioners maintain and aver that the petition in this case is within and subject to the jurisdiction of this court. [&#182;] 6. It is admitted that the child Charles G. Hannah, together with his b [next line] brothers, has been placed in the Odd Fellow Orphas [<i>sic</i>] Home, of Meadville, Pa., but it is denied that the said child was placed there at the request of the parents of said children, made shortly before their deaths, but on the contrary, it is averred, that the said child Charles G. Hannah was placed in [next page] in said home at the instance of the said grand-father, for the purpose of defeating the efforts of the petitioners to procure a decree of adoption of the said child, and the said grand-father has threatened to take the child Margaret F. Hannah away from the possession and custody of the petitioners, where she has been ever since the death of the parents of said children, and placing her in the said Home for the same purpose. [&#182;] Your petitioners further aver that it would be most conducive and to the best welfare of both said children that they be adopted by the petitioners so as to provide for them, together, a permanent home. [&#182;] 7. The petitioners deny that before the Court can entertain jurisdiction of the said child Charles G. Hannah, the consent of the guardians or overseers of the Odd fellows Orphans Home at Meadville, Pa. must be obtained, the said Institution not having any right to the possession or control of said child paramount to or that would be superior to or that would conflict or interfere with the power of the court to make the decree of adoption prayed for in this case, under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of May 28, 1915. [&#182;] 8. The petitioners do now [<i>sic</i>; not?] know, and they aver that it is immaterial and irrevelant [<i>sic</i>], whether or not the said James R. Hannah has contributed toward the support, maintenance and comfort of said minors, or that he proposes to [next line] to continue such contributions in the future. And as to sucg [<i>sic</i>] estates as said children may possess, the law will make provision for the disposition thereof, in case of adoption of the ow<strike>e</strike>ners of such estates, and that matter has no place in the consideration of the questions involved in this case. [&#182;] 9. That as to the question of the fitness of the petitioners to assume the care, custody, control, raising and training of said children, it is a matter entirely for the consideration of the court and the petitioners are willing to submit the same to and abide by the judgment of the court which may be reached upon the hearing of the case when presented. [&#182;] 10. Wherefore, the petitioners respectfully request the court to vacate and set aside the petition of the said James R. Hannah to quash and dismiss the petition in this case, and to fix a time for the hearing of the petition on its merits. [&#182;] And they will ever pray, &amp;c.&#148;&nbsp; Signed John O McClitnock, Walter J. McClintock, Attorneys for Petitioners; [attached jurat:]&nbsp; &#147;Charles L. Shaw being duly sworn according to law deposes and says that the facts set forth in the foregoing answer to the protest of James R. Hannah and motion to quash and dismiss the petition of Charles L. Shaw and Margaret L. Shaw for the adoption of Chales [<i>sic</i>] G. Hannah and Margaret F. Hannah, are correct and true as he verily believes.&#148;; sworn to and subscribed Chas. L Shaw before V. L. Greely, Prothonotary, 8 Dec. 1921; filed 2 Jan. 1922.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; [Order:]&nbsp; &#147;The first technical question raised, striking at the rest of this proceeding is, that the question involved is Res adjudicate [i.e., already decided, and the decision binding]. [&#182;] It appears from the pleadings filed, that the same petitioners filed a similar petition at No. <a href="#192002020">20 February Term, 1920</a>, in the Court of Common Pleas, praying for a decree of adoption of the same children; that a demurrer was filed thereto, alleging that said petition did not have the consent of the proper &#145;next friend&#146; of said children, in that it had only the consent of a maternal uncle, instead of a surviving grandparent; that said demurrer was sustained by the Court for the reason alleged, as appears by opinion filed December 13, 1919, without any consideration of the merits of the case. [&#182;] It is contended that our order then made it res adjudicate.&nbsp; Since filing said opinion, the Superior Court, in McGinniss&#146; Adoption, 74 S.C. 523-525, have held that the &#145;next friend&#146; is not restricted to grandparents, but a granduncle has a standing within the statute to give such consent, and said: [&#182;, indented] &#145;It is for the Court to determine whether the person consenting is really the next friend&#146;. [&#182;] Petitioner&#146;s case, therefore, went out of court on a mere technicality, concerning the law applicable thereto the court and counsel were in error. [&#182;] The heart of the controversy, then before the court, was in our jurisdiction, it being averred that the proper parties had <strike>n</strike> [next line] not joined in the petition. [&#182;] In the case of Birch v. Andrews Mill Co. 52 S.C. 193, we quote from the syllabus: [&#182;, indented] &#145;A judgment sustaining a demurrer is not res adjudicate to a second suit on the same cause of action, where the plaintiff has paid the costs of the first suit.&#146; [&#182;, indented] The court concluded as follows: [&#182;, indented] &#145;It is perfectly apparent that the first suit did not try and determine the question in controversy in the present one.&nbsp; The first was decided on a technicality and did not touch the merits of the present controversy.&#146; [&#182;] In Weigley vs. Coffman, 144 Pa. 489-499, the Supreme Court Held: [&#182;, indented] &#145;That a cause of action once finally determined without appeal between the parties, on the merits, by any competent tribunal, cannot afterwards be litigated by new proceedings, either before the same or any other tribunal.&nbsp; But no such effect is attributable to a decree dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, failure of prosecution, want of parties, or any other cause not involving the essential merits of the controversy; and where in the answer various matters of defence are set forth, some of which only relate to the maintenance of the suit and others to the merits, and there is a general decree of bill dismissed, from which it does not appear what was the prevailing ground of defence, it is impossible to hold that the decree operates to preclude future proceedings. [&#182;, indented] In Walden v. Bodley, 14 Pet. 156, it was held that a decree dismissing a bill in chancery generally, may be set up in bar of a second bill; but where the bill has been dismissed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction, which shows that the merits were not heard, the dismissal is not a bar to a second bill.&nbsp; To the same effect, also, is Hughes v. United States, 4 Wall. 232.&nbsp; From the authorities cited and the reasons assigned therein, it is plain that, when a bill is dismissed upon the ground of want of jurisdiction, the dismissal cannot be said to be upon the merits; for, whether the action of the court be right or wrong, the complainant&#146;s title to relief sought is not thereby determined.&#146; [&#182;, further indented] See Pittsbg Coal Co. v. RR Co. 227 Pa. 91-104 [next line] Roney v. Westlake, 216 Pa. 374, 380 [next line] Haws v. Tiernan, 53 Pa. 192, 194, [next line] Carmony v. Hoober, 5 Pa. 305, 307, [next line] Klick v. Gernert, 220 Pa. 503. [&#182;] In consideration of the whole matter, we are of the opinion the plea of res adjudicata cannot be sustained, and therefore, that the question is properly before us for consideration upon its [word interlined] merits. [&#182;] It follows that respondents&#146; demurrer and rule to dismiss the petition should be discharged. [&#182;, centered] ORDER. [&#182;] Now, January 2nd, 1922, protest and demurrer overruled and rule to dismiss petition is discharged.&nbsp;Per Curiam.&#148;; filed 2 Jan. 1921 [<i>sic</i>; 1922].
