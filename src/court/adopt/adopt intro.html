<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Adoption was unknown to the common law, and introduced into Pennsylvania by statute only in 1855 (see <a href="#1855">below</a>).&nbsp; The procedure instituted was for the adopting parent or parents to present a petition to the county court.&nbsp; The 1855 act, and its various amendments (presented below), did not specify which court, and hence petitions can be found in both the orphans&#146; and common pleas court records.&nbsp; Adoptions could also be lawfully effected after 2 April 1872 by recording a deed &#147;in the proper office for the recording of deeds.&#148;&nbsp; At least one &#147;<a href="adopt_in_folder.html#246576">Deed of Adoption</a>&#148; was recorded in the land records of this county.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="adopt list.html">List</a>ed and <a href="adopt_in_folder.html">abstracted</a>, in chronological order, are all adoption cases filed in Crawford County through mid 1925, after which the records are sealed.&nbsp; All petitions and affidavits were attested or acknowledged in Crawford County unless otherwise noted.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The 1855 Act was &#147;supplemented&#148; by the Act of May 9, 1887 (see below) to permit the judicial adoption of persons over the age of twenty-one.&nbsp; Adult adoptions, if not by deed, had required an act of the state legislature.&nbsp; Legislative adoptions are compiled at <a href="st.html">Statutory Adoptions</a>, and included in the <a href="adoptidx.html">index</a>.&nbsp; The state Constitution of 1872 prohibited the further adoption or legitimation of children by statute.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Some adoptions were for the purpose of providing inheritance rights to children born out of wedlock.&nbsp; Unless provision was made in a probated will, such children could not inherit from their parents, or from those with whom they lived.&nbsp; An alternative solution&mdash;and the only method before adoption became statutorily available in 1855&mdash;was to have the child declared legitimate by special act of the state legislature; see <a href="legit.html">statutory legitimations</a>.&nbsp; Special provision could also be made for illegitimate children whose parents were no longer living, and whose estates had consequently escheated or would escheat to the Commonwealth; a compilation of <a href="escheat.html">escheat-avoidance statutes</a> is also in progress.&nbsp; Some adoptions and legitimations resulted in changing the individual&#146;s name; <a href="rename.html">statutory name changes</a> are also being compiled (2019).
