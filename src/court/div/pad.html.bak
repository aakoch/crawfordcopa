The reason she gave for coming &amp; staying with the deponent was that she was very ill treated by her husband, and she said she would never return to him unless she was secure that his conduct to her would be changed. That the defendant made it a practice to stop at the house of the deponent when going to &amp; returning from Philadelphia (the house of the deponent being a public one) with a view as this deponent believed from his usual behavior to abuse and ill treat the libellant, and stopping very frequently tho he had seldom done so before the libellant came there, and at one time after some words had passed between them, which the defendant began by tantalising the libellant he stuck her twice with a cart whip that he held in his hand with great passion, and attempted to strike her several times with the butt end of the whip, but was prevented&#148;; <a name="382"></a><u>Mordecai Moore</u> states &#147;that he is a farmer of the age of thirty three and upwards &#133; that he knows both the Parties, and the libellant is his wife&#146;s aunt &#133; that about the beginning of August last the libellant [next word careted] came several times to the house of this deponent complaining that she was so ill treated by her husband that she could not live with him, and she staid at the house of this deponent for some time, but returned to the defendants house at his request and on his promising to use her well. That some time after, this deponent being at the house of the defendant, he (the defendant) told this deponent that he would give the libellant a severe whipping as ever woman had, that he followed the libellant with a large club and made a blow at her, but she getting out of his way he threw the Club at her and hit her on the shoulder, this deponent then interfered, and the defendant told the libellant to get off of his premises or he would drive her to hell. The libellant then went to the house of the deponent at his request, as he thought it unsafe for her to remain there. That something had passed before this, which this deponent did not see. This deponent has frequently seen him [parenthetical careted:] (the defendant) on other occasions attempt to strike the libellant, but was prevented, and he has declared to her in the prisence of this deponent that he had driven her away, and was determined to keep her away for he lived much better without her. This deponent saw him strike the libellant at the house of Issachar Lewis (who was not present at the time) with a cart whip. That the libellant, from what this deponent has seen of her conduct and as he believes, never gave the defendant cause to ill treat her, always behaving to him in a proper manner, and that she has not returned to her husbands house since she last came to the house of this deponent as before mentioned &#133; that the defendant owns about thirty six acres of land in Delaware County of the value of two thousand dollars, which this deponent believes and the defendant has told him is unencumbered, that the defendant is possessed also of personal property sufficient as he says to pay all his debts, and has also a house and lot in Shippensburg as this deponent believes, but of its value this deponent is ignorant.&#148;

And this Deponent further saith, That the morning [next two words careted] before that on which the said parties were married, the said Susanna had sworn the child to have been begotten by the Libellant, and thereupon the said Jacob Keister, a certain <a name="1712"></a>Casper Cloats, a Constable, Jacob Bussard, the brother of the said Susanna, and this Deponent (who attended at the instance of the Constable) went to the home of Jacob <strike>Keister</strike> Andreas, the Libellant&#146;s brother, where the Libellant makes his home, and upon seeing the Libellant, the said Jacob Keister told him, that as he, the Libellant, would not own the child, they had obtained a warrant against him, and that he must immediately go before the Justice. The said Libellant peremptorily denied that the child was his, or that he had ever had any connection with the said Susanna, and refused to consent to go before the Justice, till the said Jacob Bussard declared, that if he, the Libellant, would not go voluntarily, they would tie him hand and feet, and drag him to the Justices&#146;s on a sleigh, when from the dread of violence, the Libellant agreed to accompany the Constable to M<font size="-1"><sup><u>r</u></sup></font> Justice Horner&#146;s, which was upwards of twelve miles distant.

And this Deponent further saith, that the Libellant, having no bail, and being fearful of a commitment to prison, at length, though protesting that he never would live with her, submitted that the ceremony of marriage should proceed between him and the said Susanna, that on <strike>his</strike> [next two words careted] the Libellant&#146;s return from the Justice&#146;s, he was so drunk that he was obliged to be supported, and was immediately put to bed, that after he had been in bed sometime, the [next two words careted] said Susanna blew out the candle and lay down beside him, that in the morning they separated, the Libellant going back to his brother&#146;s house, and the said Susanna returning with the said Jacob Keister to Jacob Keister house. &#133; That he verily believes the Libellant and the said Susanna never did cohabit together either before or since their said intermarriage. &#133; That he believes the said Susanna never had any other child, but that which she swore to have been begotten by the Libellant, but which it was reported generally, had really been begotten by the said Jacob Keister.&#148;&nbsp; Testimony taken at the City of Philadelphia 14 July 1789: <a name="398"></a><u>Jacob Andreas</u>, of Lehigh Twp., Northampton Co., aged 28 years and upwards, states &#147;That he knows the parties to the above Cause, that he is the brother of the Libellant, and that the Defendant, Susanna, lives within three miles of the place of his abode. That this Deponent hath heard the above Parties were married, but that the said Abraham, the Libellant, this Deponent believes, was intoxicated at the time of the marriage, that it was a matter of compulsion on the part of the Libellant, and that none of the relations or friends of the Libellant were present at the marriage. That this Deponent believes the said Susanna to be a woman of loose and immoral character and conduct, and saith that it is generally reported that she has committed acts of fornication and adultery with a certain Jacob Keister both before and since her intermarriage with the said Libellant. That this Deponent hath seen the said Susanna and the said Jacob Keister come [careted word(s) interlined] together in a Sleigh to a Tavern (no other persons being in company with them) and after staying there sometime, they returned to the house of the said Jacob Keister, with whom the said Susanna lived for upwards of two months after her intermarriage with the said Libellant, during which two months the above transaction happened. That this Deponent hath been informed and verily believes, that since the intermarriage of the said Susanna and the Libellant, the said Susanna was seen at two different times, by <a name="1709"></a>Joseph Washborne and by <a name="1710"></a>Jacob Schwarts respectively, committing the act of adultery against a fence with the said Jacob Keister.

<u>Daniel Bickley</u>, of the City of Philadelphia, grocer, aged 33 and upwards, states [1st interrogatory] &#147;That Margaret Erben, the Libellant, is his sister, and that he hath known Adam Erben (with whom this Deponent went to School) for the space of fifteen years and upwards &#133; [2] That the above named Libellant and the said Defendant were lawfully married in the presence of this Deponent at his father&#146;s house in the Northern Liberties on the twenty first day of December in the year of our Lord One thousand seven Hundred and Eighty one, and this Deponent further answering this Interrogatory saith, That the said Libellant and the Defendant have always been reputed and considered by their neighbours and acquaintances as Husband and wife ever since their said marriage &#133; [3] That he hath truly set forth in his answer to the preceding Interrogatory the time when the said Libellant and Defendant were intermarried. And this Deponent further answering this Interrogatory saith, That for the space of Four years after their said intermarriage the Libellant and the Defendant cohabited together in great peace and harmony, but at the end of the said four years the Defendant entirely changed his conduct towards the Libellant, whom this Deponent hath seen the said Defendant abuse beat and ill treat at various times in a cruel manner. And this Deponent saith, that the Libellant to the best of his knowledge and belief never gave the Defendant any provocation or real and just cause whatsoever for using her in the manner by this Deponent above mentioned, but that the Defendant, addicting himself to the frequent and excessive use of strong liquors, has frequently returned to his house late at night, and wantonly turned the Libellant out of doors, who has thereupon come to this Deponent&#146;s house for shelter and protection. And this Deponent saith that these outrages became so frequent, that he advised the Libellant to complain thereof to a Justice of the Peace, that the Libellant accordingly complained thereof to <a name="1762"></a>Squire Masters, who thereupon bonded[?] the Defendant to appear and answer the same at the Court of Quarter Sessions (as this Deponent believes) but being persuaded by her friends and the intercessions of the friends of the Defendant, the said Libellant was induced to Settle the same amicably before the meeting of the said Court. And this Deponent further saith, That the said Defendants said cruel and abusive conduct towards the Libellant continued for the space of three years, during which time he neglected his business, squandered and wasted all his property, and was almost constantly employed it gaming and frequenting Bawdy houses, of which he would often make mention to this Deponent, naming the lewd women with whom he had been engaged in a criminal  adulterous intercourse And this Deponent further saith, that by these immoral courses he verily believes the said Defendant contracted a certain infamous and loathsome disorder, for besides that the Defendant confessed the same to this Deponent, this Deponent hath been often so informed by <a name="1762"></a>Doctor Albertus Shilack, who curded him thereof.

I have known Benjamin Rush about three years, and Deborah Rush about two years &#133; I was hired by Benjamin Rush to work in his distillery, which he carried on in Durham township, Bucks county, and I frequently saw him and a woman named Elizabeth Moyer [<i>sic</i>], who lived in the house with him as a housekeeper, in bed together. The said Elizabeth had a child with her, which Benjamin Rush was very fond of, and often said was his child: I went to live with him in November, [1802]; &amp; the said Elizabeth then lived there with her child, and continued to live there about a year; and during that time she and the said Benjamin bedded together as man and wife, except when he was away occasionally from home, or they had some quarrel between them for a short time now and then: and when she left the said Benjamin&#146;s house, she appeared to be pregnant, and I saw her about four months ago with a young child in her arms, which was not the same that she had with her when she lived at Benjamin Rush&#146;s house. At the time she left his house as I have mentioned, he brought her himself to Philadelphia, and when he returned home, took his wife Deborah Rush with him from town. &#133; The said Benjamin does not now live with his wife, the libellant: In the month of March [1804], he gave up business in the country, and came with his wife, <a name="1733"></a>John Husselbach and myself to Philadelphia where he meant to set up business. He and his wife had been upon bad terms before, and when they came to town, she remained at lodging without him a few weeks, and then went to her father&#146;s, Isaac Jones, where she has been ever since, and still is. When he came to town, I heard him tell his wife that he would not have anything more to do with her, and she was quite reconciled to parting with him. She complained of his being connected with Elizabeth Meyer and other women; and he blamed her for taking sometimes too much liquor. He acknowledged then in my hearing he had a son by Elizabeth Myer [<i>sic</i>], whom he called Benjamin Rush after himself; and that he also had a daughter by the said Elizabeth, whom he called <a name="1350"></a>Elizabeth Rush &#133; When Benjamin Rush brought Elizabeth Myer to Philadelphia, and took his wife home with him, when he returned, his wife suspected that he had been connected with Elizabeth Myer, and she asked me and John Husselbach and another young man who lived in the house whether Elizabeth Meyr had been there, and we all denied that she had been there and kept it secret for some time from M<font size="-1"><sup>rs</sup></font> Rush, but afterwards we told her that Elizabeth Myer had been there; M<font size="-1"><sup>rs</sup></font> Rush and her husband often disputed together on this account, and he often abused and scolded her and sometimes beat her and pulled her by the hair, and once took up a lamp which was burning and threw it at her. I interfered three times and oftener to prevent his beating her. For three or four weeks before they came to Philadelphia they did not sleep together; but they did sleep together after we told M<font size="-1"><sup>rs</sup></font> Rush that Elizabeth Myer had been at the house and had slept with Benjamin Rush. Since they came to Philadelphia, I have several times seen Benjamin Rush in company with the said Elizabeth Myer, and I heard the said Benjamin acknowledge in the last summer that he boarded in the same house with her, and that he was lawfully married to her; this he told his wife in my presence.&#148;; <a name="-1"></a><u>George Humes</u>, of the city of Philadelphia, distiller, states that &#147;I have known both the said Parties better than four years. &#133; I worked for Benjamin Rush at his distillery when he carried it on in Philadelphia, and afterwards when he went to Durham in Bucks county. He purchased a place there and went to build a distillery on it, in the spring of the year [1802] to the best of my recollection. I was the only person who went with him to Durham; he left his wife and child in Philadelphia. While he lived at Durham I frequently saw him and Elizabeth Myer in bed together. He brought her there as a cook; and she cooked and washed for him and some others, and slept with him. She had a child with him, which I heard Benjamin Rush acknowledge to be his. The said Elizabeth continued to live with him when I left him, which was while he lived at Durham. I have heard him talk of having connexion with several other women, and he made a joke of it. His wife was never at Durham while I was there. &#133; I have often seen Deborah Rush at her father&#146;s, Isaac Jones, since she came from Durham, and she appears to live there. I saw her <strike>first</strike> a short time after she came from Durham, at the house of a <a name="1802"></a>M<font size="-1"><sup>rs</sup></font> Powel in Green street where she then lodged. Sometime last winter I went to the house where I was told Benjamin Rush lived, and saw him there, and also Elizabeth Myers, who came in the house while I was there.&#148;; John Husselbach (signed <u>John Hasselbach</u>), of the City of Philadelphia, flour-merchant, states that &#147;I have known Benjamin Rush about three years, and Deborah Rush about two years. &#133; Benjamin Rush employed me to work in his distillery in Durham township, Bucks county, in March in the year [1802]. There was a woman named Elizabeth Moyer, that he employed as a housekeeper, and who lived there when I first went to Benjamin Rush&#146;s. She and Benjamin Rush commonly slept together, without they quarrelled, as they sometimes did. I often saw them in bed together. We kept the distillery going all night, and the men who attended it often went into Benjamin Rush&#146;s room to light a candle, or make a fire. That was the only private room in the house; there was but one bed in it, and Elizabeth Moyer had no other place to sleep in. She had a young boy with her, and I heard Benjamin Rush say he was his son. Elizabeth Moyer left the said Benjamin&#146;s house some time in the fall of [1803]. He brought her and her children down to Philadelphia. She looked to be with child then. And about five weeks after Elizabeth Moyer left his house, he brought up his wife and her son. His wife enquired about Elizabeth Moyer and whether she had been there; but we did not like to tell her at first, and we denied it; but afterwards, about three or four weeks before we broke up to move down to Philadelphia, we told her of it. Benjamin Rush being then in town. For a few nights before they came to town they did not sleep together, but I can not recollect for how long a time. In March [1804] Benjamin Rush moved to Philadelphia, and I continued in his employ about five months afterwards, and lived with him in the same house, and I saw him and the said Elizabeth Moyer in bed together almost every morning, when I got up, as I had to pass through their room. Two children of the said Elizabeth were there, which Benjamin Rush acknowledged to be his. Some time last winter, I think in the month of February, I slept one night at his house, and I saw him and the said Elizabeth in bed together; they were together the whole night and I slept in the same room. &#133; M<font size="-1"><sup>rs</sup></font> Rush did not live with her husband during the time that I stayed with him after he came to Philadelphia, and I have never seen her at his house since. I was once at her fathers and then saw her there. I do not know who the said Benjamin now lives with. I have not seen him for a good while.&#148;&nbsp; Divorced 13 Dec. 1805.&nbsp; <font size="-1">FHL film #1023005, images 405-423 (418).</font></p>

They lived together as man and wife off and on for three or four years before the year seventeen hundred and ninety nine, and were generally reputed to be man and wife. [3] I was intimate with the Parties, and often visited at their home. Samuel Shrock did not study to provide for his family, but neglected to do so. I was obliged at one time before he last left his [changed from &#145;her&#146;; next word careted] wife to take her and her <strike>two</strike> child<strike>ren</strike> and keep them for several months, because he did not provide for them.

She always conducted herself towards her husband, so far as I know or have heard, as an affectionate wife.

At the time he left her last, he left her with two children; one of whom has died since. [6] The said Samuel got no property with his wife at his marriage. She afterwards by her own industry got some furniture, not of much value. When he went away from her [next page] the last time, very little of the furniture was left, and he left her quite destitute. He last left her in the month of September one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine. She came to me on the twelfth day of that month, and her husband went away from Philadelphia eight or ten days after, and has never returned since, so far as I have seen or heard. His wife, the libellant, has lived with me ever since and still lives with me. She was obliged to leave her husbands house, when she came to me, because nothing was left in it, and he was continually drinking night and day. His wife had one letter from him since he went away; which she received upwards of four years ago; but he has not contributed at all to her maintenance.

[2] that he was not present at the marriage of the said parties. That the Respondent called upon this affirmant and requested him to visit his wife, at the house of the Respondents father, where she then was. Affirmant did so, and was there introduced to the Libellant. She was spoken of to affirmant by Respondent as his wife, and so treated by his family. Affirmants attended on her in the line of his profession for some time after, and had conversations with the Respondent, relative to the nature of her disease. [3] that he was called upon and Physician to visit the Libellant for the first time about the 12<font size="-1"><sup><u>th</u></sup></font> day of July Eighteen hundred and eleven. She then lived with the parents of the Respondent. Affirmant found her in the early state of pregnancy and afflicted with venereal ulcers, and treated her complaint as such. During affirmants attendance on her he had conversations with the Respondent, from them Affirmant was led to believe that the Respondent was afflicted with the venereal disease, and he prescribed to him under this belief, directing him to take mercury, which directions he for some time persued. In the course of these visits, Affirmant was led to believe from the conversations &amp; confessions of the Respondent to him, that he had communicated venereal affection to his wife. That some months after, affirmant was first called to visit the Libellant, he was requested to attend her in her laying in. That he did attend her on that occasion, and delivered her of a still born child, which affirmant thinks was probably produced, by the mercurial treatment she had undergone. [4] affirmant refers for his answer, to what he has said in his answer to the second interrogatory [5] this affirmant cannot answer. [6] that the Respondent has been twice under his care, for the venereal disease, since the separation between him and the Libellant. That a very few days after their seperation, the mother of the Libellant, accompanied by her son &amp; the Libellant called on affirmant to ascertain &amp; discover whether he thought the Libellant has been affected [<i>sic</i>] with the Venereal Complaint since her confinement, and also to know whether at that time, she was free from it. Affirmant did in consequence of this make the necessary enquiries, and to guard against all risks administered mercury to her, until it slightly affected her mouth. He believes that he was right in doing what he then advised, from what they had told him of the conduct of the Respondent, but more especially, from what he has since seen and known of the Respondent, and the diseased condition of his system, proceeding as affirmant believes from his looseness and irregularities.&#148;; <a name="1853"></a><u>Thomas Mahon</u>, &#147;of the City of Philadelphia aged nineteen years and upwards,&#148; answers &#147;[1] that he has no acquaintance with the Libellant, that he has known the Respondent for about two or three years.

In particular &#133; that after the celebration of said marriage the said James Thompson gave himself up to the drinking of spirituous liquors, and by habits of intoxication hath become incapable of managing his estate and taking care of his family as a husband ought to do. That in these fits of intoxication and at all times, particularly in the year 1786, he beat the libellant in a cruel and unmerciful manner and by his threats and outrageous conduct put her in fear of her Life.

Her father was at my house at the same time, and desired me to call him early one morning, because he wanted to go to the horse market. I got up to call him a little after sun rise, and was obliged to go through a room in which Thomas Search, one of my boarders, slept, in order to call him, and I saw the said Thomas Search and Sarah Walton the defendant in bed together and in the act of committing adultery.
