January 17, 1851 John Shauberger one of the Overseers of Athens Township appears and enters an appeal in this case, from the dicession and order of removal of said Justices."  Subpoena issued 21 Jan. 1851 to Henry Hatch, Charles Loop, Henry Y. Porter, L. S. Birdsley, Joseph Hutcheson, William Richards; all shown on B/C ack. 14 Feb. 1851.  Rule entered 10 Feb. 1851 to either party to take testimony, &c d.b.e. on one day's notice.  Deposition of witnesses [one only] taken before Wm. D. Tucker, JpP., at the house of Jesse Rupp in the Borough of Meadville 12 Feb. 1851, both parties being present with their counsel:  "Mary F Wilson being sworn deposes and says, I have known Charles Frederick Cunningham ever since he was two or three days old in the year 1800[;] he was born in New Boston Hillsborough County, State of New Hamshire, he was an illigitamate child, he lived there until 1806 and then they moved into the Parish of Penfield in the Province of New Brumswick, under the rule of the King of England, it was in 1836 that he left there - I think in November of that year, when he left and come to Pennsylvania, he came to Athens Township Crawford County; he was here two years before I came, but when I came I found him in Athens Township, he never could be learned to read, I think it was but six letters that they could learn him, he went to shool in New Hamshire, and in the eastern Country,  My Mother was the means of his comeing here, her name was Sarah McNeil, She had a son here by the name of Vryling S McNeil and he wrote for her to come, and she came and brought Cunningham, and I am sure that he did not write to have her bring him, When he came to Athens he lived with Vryling S McNeil, and Sarah S McNeal lived with him also until she died in 1839, then after my Mother died Vryling S McNeil had a housekeeper and Cunningham lived there with them until I think two or three years after my Mother died, then My Brother sent him to Hogg's four miles from Meadville in Mead Tpt. and he remained there about eleven months, My Mother had charge of him from the time he was thirteen months old until she died.   Cross examined  My Mother took him to New Brunswick when he was six years old, her husband sent for her - he was there before she went there and took Cunningham with her, her husband was my father so my Mother said, My father had a little property in New Brunswick, he was a native of New Brunswick Hamshire. After Cunningham left Hoggs, he went - I think to Phillp's, to Reuben Phillips.
