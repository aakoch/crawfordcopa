county, where he remained about fourteen years.&nbsp; He then went to Rockdale
Township, this county, immediately turning his attention to farming, and
here he remained twenty-three years.&nbsp; He next came to his present farm of 100
acres of excellent land, in Richmond Township, this county, well cultivated
and stocked.&nbsp; Mr. Bowman was married March 15, 1840, to Caroline A.
