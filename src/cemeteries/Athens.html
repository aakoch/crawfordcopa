<br><a name="Amy"></a><i>Name</i>:&nbsp; <b>Amy Cemetery</b>
<dt><i>From Eugene F. Throop&#146;s index</i>:&nbsp; The cemetery was originally about 200 yards off the road, but was moved to gain more tillable farmland.&nbsp; Currently, there is one tombstone lying against a foundation of an old house about one mile south of Little Cooley, Pa., on the road that turns off S.R. 77 beside the grocery store at Little Cooley.&nbsp; Ambram R. Amy (1853-1919, buried Drake Cem.) lived on this farm most of his life, inheriting it from his father Ezra T. Amy.&nbsp; People remember one or two Hastings tombstones; they were related to the Amys in some way.&nbsp; Indexed 5 April 1977.
<dd>Amy, Ezra T., d. 16 Dec. 1863 in the 36th year of his age; &#147;Put your trust in the Lord&#147;

<dt><i>From Eugene F. Throop&#146;s index</i>:&nbsp; The cemetery contains only one stone, although there are bases for two others.&nbsp; There are indications that the other gravestones were removed.&nbsp; The cemetery is abandoned and overgrown.&nbsp; It is located on the south side of Twp.Rt. 473, east of Muddy Creek, and is marked by one pine tree and a heavy growth of myrtle close to the road.&nbsp; The Veterans Affairs Office had veterans Simeon Bailey and Jedidiah Shaver marked here, but says that they were removed to the nearly Drake Cemetery in 1959.&nbsp; Grandin Drake says the last burial was Mrs. Graham, about 1910, but she had no stone erected.&nbsp; Research suggests that she was Amanda, wife of John C. Graham, who lived 14 April 1837 to 27 August 1907.&nbsp; Indexed 3 September 1969:

Throop&#146;s index</i>:&nbsp; Where the cemetery was located, on the east side of Leg.Rt. 20090 one-half mile south of S.R. 77, there is now a plowed field.&nbsp; Grandin Drake removed the Glass family, Roderick Foot and wife, and Joseph King to the Drake Cemetery in 1964.&nbsp; The Veterans Affairs Office had marked the cemetery as having veterans because Roderick Foot and Joseph King both were veterans.&nbsp; I found all this out in August-September 1968.

Smith stone I saw the year before.&nbsp; I have numbered the rows as counting from the road eastward. &nbsp; Seventy-five marked graves from 1837-1950:
