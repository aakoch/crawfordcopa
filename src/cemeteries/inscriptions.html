  Building upon a series begun in the first issue of <i>Crawford County Genealogy</i>, the Crawford County Genealogical Society in 1982 began publication of <i>Crawford County Pa. Cemetery Inscriptions</i> in conjunction with the Crawford County Historical Society.&nbsp; Cemetery indexes prepared by Eugene F. Throop were purchased as part of this project, and the Society or various of its members also indexed numerous cemeteries.&nbsp; Other cemetery indexes on file at the Historical Society library were also utilized, most notably those prepared by Halver Getchell, the late Adelaide Courtney, and the late Mary C. Cousins.&nbsp; The Historical Society later left the project, which was abandoned after the 1989 publication of Volume IV.
  <br>
  <br>All volumes are soft cover; the cost of each was originally $12.50, plus $2.00 postage, handling, and state sales tax.&nbsp; Please check with the Crawford County Historical Society for current availability.
