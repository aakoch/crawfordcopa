<dd><font size="-1">&lt;page <b>444</b>&gt;</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>The Old Cemetery.</i>--When David Mead laid out Meadville, he set apart one acre of ground north of Randolph Street, on what is now Park Avenue, for a cemetery.&nbsp; Soon after the organization of the First Presbyterian Church in 1800, Gen. Mead deeded the ground to that body.&nbsp; The church subsequently purchased two acres adjoining the old lot on the north, and this cemetery was used as a general burial-ground until the opening of Greendale, when the bodies were removed and the land sold.
<dd><font size="-1">&lt;page <b>445</b>&gt;</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Greendale Cemetery.</i>--On the 11th of March, 1852, " The Meadville Cemetery " was incorporated by the following citizens of the borough: ...&nbsp; The name of the ground was subsequently changed to " The Greendale Cemetery," which title it still bears.&nbsp; The association was organized April 21, 1852, and the following officers chosen:&nbsp; ...&nbsp; A site of rare beauty and combining many advantages was in due time secured by the purchase of about fifty-three acres of land in the northeastern suburbs of the town.&nbsp; The grounds were enclosed and partially laid out by the formal opening-day, August 31, 1853, on which occasion John Reynolds, Esq., delivered an appropriate address.
<dd> &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the first purchase was made an additional purchase of twenty-eight acres has been added to the cemetery, and it now contains over eighty acres.&nbsp; Sound judgment and good taste were alike employed in the choice and in the laying out of Greendale Cemetery.&nbsp; ....
