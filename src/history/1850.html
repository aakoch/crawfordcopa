<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following circular was distributed, in the early part of 1845, very extensively through the state, and the succeeding papers in the volume were received in reply to it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In communicating information with regard to any book or manuscript, &amp;c., please furnish the following particulars:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title, name of writer, date, and general nature of the book or document.

<br><font size="-1">&lt;page <b>111</b>&gt;</font> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not omit in your reply anything of local or historical interest, because it may seem trivial or unworthy of notice, or may not be embraced in the foregoing questions.&nbsp; <i>Collect all you can;</i>
whatever it may be, it will be clear gain.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unable to answer any particular question or branch of a question, please designate it merely by its number, &amp;c.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave a margin of about an inch at both sides of the page of your answer, in order that it may be properly bound with others which may be received.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of donors, and of those who acknowledge the receipt of this letter, or communicate any information, will, unless it shall be otherwise requested, be properly noticed, and also preserved upon the journals of the Society.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All donations of manuscripts will be carefully preserved in the fire-proof of the Society.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the heavy expense of postage, be pleased to request those who may be disposed to reply to this letter to send their communications through you, as postmaster, to the
Society.&nbsp; Private opportunities for the transmission of donations, would be preferred.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please address your communications to the Corresponding Secretary, No. 99 Spruce Street, or to the Recording Secretary, No. 108 South Fourth Street, or to any other of the officers of the Society.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This occasion is embraced earnestly to entreat all persons to prevent, as far as it may be in their power, the loss of letters or documents which have bearing upon the history of our state or 
country.&nbsp; Many papers of great in- <font size="-1">&lt;page <b>112</b>&gt;</font> terest must have been already lost through the indifference of their owners, but we hope that no one whom this appeal shall reach, will fail to assist us in the emdeavour to preserve the evidence of our history.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding we would say, that the motives of the Society in sending you this letter, are of a public nature, and that whatever collections shall be made will be for the benefit of the people of
Pennsylvania.
