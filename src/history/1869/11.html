<p>until 1799, when he became one of the Associate Judges of Crawford County.&nbsp; He was appointed, by <a name="4"></a>Gov. McKean, a Major General of Militia, subsequently re-appointed by <a name="5"></a>Gov. Snyder, and continued to discharge the duties of that office until the commissions in the militia were vacated by law.&nbsp; He was a man of great liberality and hospitality, and of wonderful energy and public spirit.&nbsp;  He presented the ground now known as the Public Square in Meadville to the (then) borough, and the old grave yard property to the trustees of the Presbyterian Church.&nbsp; He also donated the property, upon which is erected the First District School Building, to the State, for the Arsenal which has recently been removed.&nbsp; In person Gen. Mead was a man of remarkable size, being six feet and three and a half inches in height, and built in proportion.&nbsp; He died suddenly August 23, 1816, in the 65th year of his age, and in full vigor of body and mind.

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The building of a second Methodist Episcopal Church has been commenced on State street in the north-eastern part of the city, and it is expected that it will be ready for occupancy during the present year.&nbsp; The foundation has been laid for the erection of a new Roman Catholic Cathedral, on the corner of Main and Pine streets.&nbsp; It will be a large and costly edifice.&nbsp; The First Methodist Episcopal Church is the finest and most expensive structure of the kind in North-western Pennsylvania, and is, in all its arrangements, a splendid specimen of architecture, an ornament to the city and a credit to the public spirit and zeal of the denomination to which it belongs.
