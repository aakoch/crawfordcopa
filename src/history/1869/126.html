<p>Looking at the city from the heights&#151;its white houses, its business blocks, and the several spires of its churches, give us no intimation of newness, but it partakes of the look of an old town&#151;though the absence of shade trees, or rather the presence of thousands of young trees, indicate that it has but recently acquired that permanent and steady growth, which has marked the past two years.
