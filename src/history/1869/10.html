<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In the days when the French held possession of the territory west of the Alleghenies, a fort, or blockhouse, one of the chain of forts connecting Lake Erie and the Ohio river was located where Meadville now stands.&nbsp;  The blockhouse used by the early settlers as a protection against the Indians stood close to where the Water street bridge crosses the canal.

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A State Arsenal was established here in 1816, and was used as a store house for arms until the breaking out of the late rebellion, when the arms were removed for active service in the field.&nbsp; During the war the building was used for a time as a rendezvous for recruits.&nbsp; By an act of the Legislature the property was transferred to the city for school purposes, and the ground is now occupied by the First District Public School,&#151;one of the handsomest edifices of the kind in the country.&nbsp; The old arsenal building was demolished during the past summer.

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  <a name="2"></a>G<font size="-1">EN.</font> D<font size="-1">AVID</font> M<font size="-1">EAD</font>, the founder of Meadville, was born at Hudson, N. Y.&nbsp;  He afterwards removed with his father to the Wyoming Valley.&nbsp; In 1774 he married and subsequently removed to Sunbury, where he carried on an inn and erected a distillery, and succeeded in accumulating some property, but owing to disputes about the titles to the lands he was forced to leave that locality, with only a portion of his goods.&nbsp; Subsequent efforts to regain his possessions there were unavailing, but he finally obtained from the State lands of equal value on French Creek.&nbsp; In 1789 he removed with his family to the banks of French Creek.&nbsp; The settlements were in those early days terribly harassed by the Indians, and this region was insecure until after <a name="3"></a>Gen. Wayne&#146;s treaty in 1794.&nbsp; In 1791 Gen. Mead took his family to Franklin to be in reach of the garrison during the threatened invasion of the savages.&nbsp; It was at this time that his father was captured in a field at his work and was carried by two Indians to the vicinity of Conneaut Lake.&nbsp; Some days afterwards, he was found, together with one of the Indians, both dead, and leaving such marks of violence as showed that they had had a contest.&nbsp; It was thought that the other Indian had been hurt in the combat and fled.
