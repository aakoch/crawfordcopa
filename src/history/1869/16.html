<p>Located in the Cullum Block, corner of Water and Chestnut streets, is to be one of the institutions of the city.&nbsp; The following description of it is taken from T<font size="-1">HE</font> M<font size="-1">EADVILLE</font> D<font size="-1">AILY</font> R<font size="-1">EPUBLICAN</font>, of July 20, 1869 :
