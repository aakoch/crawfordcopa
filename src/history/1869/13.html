<p>the sum of $2,000 was granted by the State, which was subsequently increased to $7,000.

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The very valuable library which the institution possesses was obtained mainly by the untiring zeal of Mr. Alden, who performed one or more tours through the Eastern States to solicit aid from learned and benevolent individuals for his infant seminary.&nbsp; The most liberal contributor was the <a title="8"></a>Rev. Dr. Bentley, a Unitarian clergyman, of Salem, Mass., who had spent his life in amassing one of the rarest collections of theological works in the country.&nbsp; Harvard University had set her eyes upon this collection, and having bestowed a preliminary <i>plum</i>, in the shape of an LL.
