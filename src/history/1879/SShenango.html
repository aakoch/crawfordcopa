 &nbsp; &nbsp; The original formation of the township dates to 1811.&nbsp; The first settlers were <a name="196"></a>Hugh Fletcher, <a name="197"></a>Robert McConahey, <a name="198"></a>James Davis and <a name="199"></a>Michael Marshall, about 1797.&nbsp; <a name="200"></a>Robert Bennett established himself about 1798, and <a name="201"></a>James Dickey arrived in 1799.&nbsp; The first grist mill was built on Shenango Creek in 1830, by <a name="202"></a>John Clyde, and the first saw mill in 1842, by <a name="203"></a>Wm. Lewis; both have long since fallen a prey to the ruthless ravages of time.&nbsp; The pioneer school was taught in a round-log house.&nbsp; The oldest church organization was begun in 1801, when the United Presbyterian Church was formed by <a name="204"></a>Rev. Daniel McLean, with ten members.&nbsp; The first services were held in a tent, next in a log house, built in 1805; and at last in a church erected in 1818, one mile north of State road.&nbsp; The township contains 17,102 acres.&nbsp; The population, according to the census of 1870, is 1,042.&nbsp; It contains eight schools, with an average attendance of 168.&nbsp; The amount expended for school purposes is about $2000 a year.&nbsp; The Erie and Pittsburgh Railroad passes through the township in the western part.
