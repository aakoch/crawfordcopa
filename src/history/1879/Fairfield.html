<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This township is situated on the west bank of French Creek, and as originally founded in 1811 [<i>sic</i>], comprised East Fallowfield [<i>sic</i>; East Fairfield], which was made from it in 1869.&nbsp; It has an area of 10,756 acres.&nbsp; The surface is hilly in the northern, but more level in the southern parts.&nbsp; It is watered by French Creek and Conneaut Outlet.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was 871.&nbsp; The first settlement was made in this locality as early as 1791, by <a name="89"></a>Joseph Dickson, on the farm now owned by <a name="90"></a>E. P. Slocum.&nbsp; Five years later <a name="91"></a>Archibald Hill came from Ireland into what was then a wilderness, and a year after came <a name="92"></a>Andrew McFadden.&nbsp; The first school organized was in 1810, and was taught by a <a name="93"></a>Mr. Douglass.&nbsp; There are now 7 schools, with an average attendance of 239 pupils, conducted at an annual expense of about $1,000.&nbsp; The first township library in Crawford county was owned by this township.
