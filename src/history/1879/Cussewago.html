<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This township lies just west of the centere [<i>sic</i>] of the northern border line of townships, and was organized in the year 1811.&nbsp; The first settlement was made by <a name="75"></a>Robt. Irwin in 1795.&nbsp; In a few years other pioneers followed; clearings and humble cabin homes began to be seen all about the region.&nbsp; The subsequent early settlers were <a name="76"></a>John and <a name="77"></a>Alexander Sweeny, <a name="78"></a>John Clawson, <a name="79"></a>John Chamberlain, <a name="80"></a>Jacob Hilts, and <a name="81"></a>Lewis Thickstun.&nbsp; <a name="82"></a>Thomas Potter, in 1813, erected the first saw mill, and in 1831 the first grist mill was built by the same.&nbsp; The original school was taught in 1804 by <a name="83"></a>Owen David, near Mosiertown, and various other schools were conducted, increasing in number yearly till 1836, when the public school system was adopted.&nbsp; There are now 12 schools, with an average attendance of 230 pupils, conducted at an expense of about $1800 annually.&nbsp; The soil is finely adapted to agriculture, stock raising and dairying, and is watered by Cussewago Creek.&nbsp; To all of the above mentioned pursuits the inhabitants devote themselves, but dairying and cheese making are, perhaps, the leading occupations.&nbsp; The present township
contains 23,496 acres, and the population at the last census was 1,674.

<br><a name="Mosiertown"></a>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; M<font size="-1">OSIERTOWN</font> is the most flourishing village in the township, situate[d] a little southeast of the centre.&nbsp; It contains two churches, Baptist and Lutheran, Rev. <a name="84"></a>Ganmer being pastor of the latter.&nbsp; It has also one school, one hotel; one general, one drug, and one millinery store; one cheese factory, one blacksmith's, one shoemaker's, one paint and one wagon shop.
