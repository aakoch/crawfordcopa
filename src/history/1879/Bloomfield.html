<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This township was one of the original divisions of the county, and at its inception was twelve miles long by six wide.&nbsp; In 1830 one half was taken off, forming a part of Sparta, leaving Bloomfield with an extent of 39,465 acres.&nbsp; The first settlement in this territory was made in 1795.&nbsp; From this time on the land was slowly taken up and improved by the pioneers, among whom the first were <a name="21"></a>James Byron, <a name="22"></a>Joseph Kirk, <a name="23"></a>John Taylor, <a name="24"></a>James Winders, <a name="25"></a>Richard Shreve, <a name="26"></a>Lewis Agnew and <a name="27"></a>Stephen Bloomfield.&nbsp; The first grist mill was built on Oil Creek in 1800, by <a name="28"></a>James Hamilton.&nbsp; The first school was held near Tillotson's Corners in 1820, <a name="29"></a>Isaac Bloomfield, teacher.&nbsp; The township now has eleven schools, employing twenty-one instructors, conducted at an annual expense of about $2,600.&nbsp; The principal pursuits of the inhabitants are lumbering and dairying.&nbsp; The stream Oil Creek runs through the township, forming at one point Oil Creek Lake.&nbsp; The Union and Titusville R. R. extends along the Oil Creek valley.
