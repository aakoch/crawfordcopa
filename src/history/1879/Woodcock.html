<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was made in Woodcock as early as 1791 by <a name="302"></a>James Humes, who located upon a tract one mile west of Woodcockboro.&nbsp; Three years later came <a name="303"></a>Henry Rust, <a name="304"></a>John H. Bossard and <a name="305"></a>James Long, the latter of whom died in 1830, in the ninety-third year of his age.&nbsp; <a name="306"></a>Arthur and <a name="307"></a>Patrick McGill moved in during 1795, and settled upon a tract of eight hundred acres.&nbsp; The year 1797 witnessed the arrival of <a name="308"></a>Saml. Blair and <a name="309"></a>George Long.&nbsp; About the same period <a name="310"></a>William Wykoff, accompanied by his son <a name="311"></a>John, emigrated from New Jersey and located upon Gravel Run.&nbsp; Among the other early settlers were <a name="312"></a>John Greenlee, <a name="313"></a>Nathaniel Clark, <a name="314"></a>George Peiffer, a veteran of the Revolution, and <a name="315"></a>Thomas Rice.&nbsp; The first saw mill constructed in the township, was built at the mouth of Gravel
Run, by <a name="316"></a>Archibald Humes.&nbsp; Soon afterwards was added a grist mill, now owned by <a name="317"></a>Mr. Apple.&nbsp; The township contains three boroughs, viz: Saegertown, Wookcockboro, and Blooming Valley.&nbsp; The first church built in the township was erected on Gravel Run, by the Presbyterians in 1809.&nbsp; The Methodists organized a society during the following year, and their first church was constructed of logs in 1817.&nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,943, all of whom except ninety-six being native born.&nbsp; During the year 1878 it contained thirteen schools, and employed twenty-four teachers.&nbsp; The number of pupils enrolled in the several schools was 428, with an average attendance of 292.&nbsp; The amount expended for the maintenance of the schools during the same period was $1,906.05.
