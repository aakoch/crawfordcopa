<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlement of the township was made about 1798, and among the earlier settlers were <a name="59"></a>William and <a name="60"></a>Thomas Rankin, <a name="61"></a>Samuel Paterson, <a name="62"></a>Robert and <a name="63"></a>William Latta, the latter building the first frame structure in the township.&nbsp; Many others settled about this time, but owing to an alleged breach of faith of the Holland Land Company, from whom they derived the grants, they soon left.&nbsp; The township was founded in 1811 [<i>sic</i>], and derives its name from a lake of the same name.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is situated on the western border of the county, north of the centre, and contains 23,896 square acres.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1729.&nbsp; The soil is well adapted to the production of grass, grain, and to stock raising and dairying, the principal avocation of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The Erie &amp; Pittsburg[h] Railroad passes through the eastern part.&nbsp; The first school house was built in 1818, and the first teacher was a <a name="64"></a>Mr. Smith.&nbsp; Another school house was built at Penn Line, in 1820, and the following year one was built at Summit station.&nbsp; At present there are 16 schools, with an average attendance of 410 pupils, conducted at an annual expense of about $2,400.
