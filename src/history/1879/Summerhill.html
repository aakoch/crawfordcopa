<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Summerhill township possesses an area of 14,608 acres and lies west of the centre of the county.&nbsp; It is abundantly watered by Conneaut Creek, Pine Run, which empties into Conneaut Lake, and a small tributary of the Cussewago.&nbsp; The soil is for the most part fertile, and is well cultivated.&nbsp; The population is to a large extent descended from New England stock.&nbsp; The first settlement was made, however, by <a name="238"></a>Valentine Quin, of French parentage, in 1803.&nbsp; The elder Quin was a companion of <a name="239"></a>Lafayette in his first visit to this country, and under him served in the war of the Revolution.&nbsp; Lumbering and dairying form the leading pursuits of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The Post-offices of this township are Dicksonburg and Norrisville.&nbsp; There are now 10 schools, with an average attendance of 188 pupils, conducted at a yearly expense of about $1,600.
