<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; O<font size="-1">IL</font> C<font size="-1">REEK</font> T<font size="-1">OWNSHIP</font> was formed in 1820, and lies in the south-east corner of the county, bordering upon Warren and Venango counties.&nbsp; Oil Creek runs directly through, and with the smaller streams emptying into it furnishes abundant water power for the lumbering interest of the township, which is very large.&nbsp; Among the first settlements made, <a name="129"></a>Jonathan Titus came to this locality in 1790 with <a name="130"></a>Samuel Titus, and located on the site of Titusville.&nbsp; Not long afterward, <a name="131"></a>John Thompson settled at Kerr's Hill, followed by <a name="132"></a>Andrew Kerr.&nbsp; <a name="133"></a>Daniel and <a name="134"></a>Peter Titus, brothers of Jonathan, took up 400 acres each at Hydetown, and <a name="135"></a>John Ridgway built the first saw mill there.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Petroleum was known to the earlier settlers, but it was not until the first well of <a name="136"></a>Col[.] Drake's in Aug. 1859 was completed that the great oil interests of the township sprang up, giving extraordinary impetus to all the affairs of the southern portion, making it the richest of the county, and creating the city of Titusville.&nbsp; Though now out of the great producing district, there is no doubt plenty of oil under the hills and valleys, waiting better times for production.&nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was (exclusive of Titusville,) 2,041.&nbsp; There are eleven schools, with an attendance of 205.&nbsp; The yearly expense of the schools is about $2,500.
