<blockquote>
Was formed in 1831, and contains 17,113 square acres.&nbsp; It is situated near the center of the
county.&nbsp; The settlement of the township was made by a pioneer named <a name="1"></a>Smith, between 1790 and 1800.&nbsp; After struggling against the wilderness and Indians for some years, he abandoned his
improvements and his latter fate is unknown.&nbsp; His successors were <a name="2"></a>Elisha Root, Dr. <a name="3"></a>Silas Taylor, <a name="4"></a>Jonah Edson, <a name="5"></a>Wm. King, <a name="6"></a>John Shauberger and <a name="7"></a>Abram Wheeler.&nbsp; The soil is of average quality, being adapted to the growth of grass, barley, rye, oats, corn and buckwheat.&nbsp; It is well watered by Muddy Creek and Oil Creek and their tributaries.&nbsp; The industries are lumbering, milling and agriculture.&nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,317.&nbsp; The township is crossed in the northeast corner by the Union &amp; Titusville Railroad.&nbsp; The first school was held about 1826 at Dr. Taylor's, in a house 12 by 16 feet, built of logs.&nbsp; There were in 1877 ten school buildings, employing 12 or 15 teachers, with an average attendance of 207 pupils.&nbsp; The cost per year of the
schools is about $2,000

<br><a name="LCooley"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; LITTLE COOLEY is situated in the western part of the township, on the west side of Muddy Creek.&nbsp; It contains one church, United Brethren, <a name="8"></a>Rev. R. Smith, pastor, one school house, one drug store, one grocery, one dry goods and two millinery stores, one harness, one wagon, two blacksmith, and two shoemaker's shops, one painter, a grist mill and a cheese-box factory, one hotel and about 200 inhabitants.&nbsp; The Mutual Protective Association meets weekly.
