<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Sparta was formed in 1830.&nbsp; It lies [in] the north-eastern corner of the county, and contains 23,913 acres.&nbsp; It is well watered by the branches of Oil Creek, and Spaulding and Brittain Runs,&nbsp; The lumber interest of the township is quite large, and the Pittsburgh, Buffalo &amp; Titusville Railroad, which crosses the township along the valley of Oil Creek, affords fine facilities of transportation.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,131.&nbsp; This township has been settled within a comparatively recent date.&nbsp; <a name="215"></a>Reuben and <a name="216"></a>Abraham Blakeslee moved from Washington County to Sparta in 1818, being the pioneers.&nbsp; The township now contains six schools, with an average attendance of 106 scholars.&nbsp; The amount expended annually for school purposes is about $900.&nbsp; The borough of Spartansburg and Glyndon are the only post-offices in the township.
