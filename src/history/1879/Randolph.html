<blockquote>
W<font size="-1">AS</font> formed in 1824, and is located a little south of the centre of the county.&nbsp; It contains 23,697 square acres.&nbsp; The surface is hilly, and drained by Woodcock and Sugar Creeks; the soil is adapted to grazing and stock raising.&nbsp; The first settler was <a name="142"></a>James Brawley, who came from Lycoming county in 1795, and took up a tract in the southwestern part of the township, and built the first log house.&nbsp; He was married in 1800 to <a name="143"></a><a name="144"></a>Mary Glenn.&nbsp; The settlers who came next were <a name="145"></a>Amos Daniels, in the southwestern part, <a name="146"></a>Alex. McFadden, in the southern part, <a name="147"></a>Archibald Stewart, <a name="148"></a>Michael Radle, and <a name="149"></a>Dennis Kane.&nbsp; <a name="150"></a>Joseph Guy settled at Guy's Mills, where the first house was erected for him, and he also built a saw mill at the same place in 1817.&nbsp; He was the first Justice of the Peace, and surveyed a large number of the farms for his neighbors.&nbsp; The first school was taught by Miss <a name="151"></a>Mary H. Guy, in the upper story of a barn, and the first school house was built in the southwestern part.&nbsp; It was made of logs, with greased paper for windows.&nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,732.&nbsp; At present there are thirteen schools in the
township, the average number of pupils being 325, and the expenses per annum being about $2,000.&nbsp; The post
offices of the township are Hickory Corners, and the village of Guy's Mills.
