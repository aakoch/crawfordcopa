<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; This township was formed in 1790.&nbsp; It lies upon French Creek, a little south of the centre, and contains 25,472 square acres.&nbsp; The first settlement of the locality was made in 1787, by <a name="117"></a>John and <a name="118"></a>David Mead, from Northumberland County, which also was the first settlement made in the county.&nbsp; They were accompanied by <a name="119"></a>Joseph Mead, <a name="120"></a>Thos. Martin, <a name="121"></a>John Watson, <a name="122"></a>James T. Randolph, <a name="123"></a>Thomas Grant, <a name="124"></a>Cornelius Van Horne and <a name="125"></a>Christopher Snyder.&nbsp; Having established themselves in the rudest manner they were soon joined by other settlers, until quite a colony was formed.&nbsp; In 1789 <a name="126"></a>Sarah Mead was born, the first white birth in the county.&nbsp; The history of these pioneers is one of toil, privation and death from the hands of hostile Indians, up to 1795, the time of the <a name="127"></a>General Wayne treaty with the Western Indians.&nbsp; After this, affairs moved more prosperously, and a substantial growth took the place of the uncertainty and has continued since, until the valley of French Creek is lined with productive farms, and the city of Meadville, county seat, lies on the site of the early trials and dangers.&nbsp; Mead Corners and the village of Frenchtown are the post offices of the township, the latter deriving its name from the fact that the majority of its residents are of French extraction.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870, exclusive of Meadville, was 2,421.&nbsp; The first log school house was erected at what was known as the Randolph settlement.&nbsp; At present there are 16 schools in the township, with an average attendance of 325 scholars.&nbsp; The annual cost is about $3,000.
