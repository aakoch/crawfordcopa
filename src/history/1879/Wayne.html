<blockquote>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlements of record, in this vicinity were made by <a name="294"></a>James D. Allen and <a name="295"></a>Amos Wheeling, of Ireland, in 1819, when the place was literally a howling wilderness.&nbsp; The years that followed brought <a name="296"></a>Francis McDaniels, from Lancaster county, <a name="297"></a>William Record and <a name="298"></a>James Ferry.&nbsp; <a name="299"></a>Jacob Ruse came from Philadelphia, and located at the site of Deckard's P. O.&nbsp; The township was formed in 1811, and as originally organized contains 2066 acres of good arable soil.&nbsp; The shape of the township is that of a right angle triangle, the hypothenuse being denticulated after the manner of&nbsp; a saw.&nbsp; It is well watered by French Creek, Sugar Creek, and Deckard's run.&nbsp; Sugar Lake, a small body of water in the Northern part, furnishes fine fishing for the inhabitants, who numbered in 1870, 1,464, of whom only 105 were foreigners.&nbsp; The churches of the township are the Evangelical reformed Church, the Church of United Brethren, the Freewill Baptist, at Deckard's, and Zion's Church (Dutch Reformed,) at Wayne Centre.&nbsp; There are twelve schools, with an average attendance of 390 pupils, conducted at an annual cost of about $2,000.&nbsp; The only Post office within the township limits is Deckard's.
