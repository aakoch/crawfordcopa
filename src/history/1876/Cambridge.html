<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This township was organized in 1852 from Venango, and includes an area of eleven thousand one hundred and sixty-two square acres.&nbsp; The soil is fertile and well watered.&nbsp; It is crossed by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, which traverses the valley of French Creek, and by the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad, which crosses from west to east the central portion.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was seven hundred and forty-seven, and mostly native born.&nbsp; The first settlers in this locality were Robert Humes, Michael Sherred, Archibald Humes, John Shearer, and Henry Baugher, the latter a native of Harrisburg and an immigrant of 1800.&nbsp; Those preceding came to this township about 1797.&nbsp; Leonard Doctor came in 1801 from Susquehanna County, and located Lot 128.&nbsp; The year 1811 saw the arrival of Thomas Fullerton, Isaac Kelly, Edward Hicks, James Durham, James Weston,&nbsp; James Sinclair, and Alexander Anderson.&nbsp; John Langley, of Ireland came in 1812;&nbsp; James Birchard and Amos Ames, of Massachusetts, in 1813; and Daniel and Sylvester Root, of the Bay State, in 1819.&nbsp; Robert Humes settled on the first farm located in the township.&nbsp; It is known as Lot 141, and is now occupied by David Humes, his son.&nbsp;  Archibald Humes erected the first grist-mill in the township.&nbsp; A large tract of land was purchased in 1813 by Charles T. Cummings and Dr. Perkins, and sold out to Massachusetts emigrants.&nbsp; In consequence of its New England occupants, it bears the name of Yankee Hill.&nbsp; A pioneer church was organized, with twelve members, on October 31, 1812, by Revs. William West and Thomas Rigdon, and first known as the Lebanon Baptist Church.&nbsp; The Rev. George Miller officiated as the first pastor, and the names of the original members are George Miller, Alexander Anderson, Isaac Kelly, John Langley, James and Lydia Anderson, Sarah Clark, Barbara and Christina Miller, Hannah Kelly, and Elizabeth Daniel.&nbsp; As illustrative of the strict and wholesome discipline enjoined upon early church members, it was required that every member attend every meeting.&nbsp; One failure required an excuse; two failures resulted in an investigation and report at the next meeting.&nbsp; When wrong was done by any member, judicious counsel and reproof were given.&nbsp; Annual meetings were held, beginning on a Saturday afternoon and continued over the Sabbath.&nbsp; Visitors from other churches were expected and&nbsp; heartily greeted.&nbsp; Evening meetings were extended till late at night.&nbsp; Protracted meetings, when voted, were attended from first to last.&nbsp; Notice was given to friends.&nbsp; Other than their own pastors would attend and help in the exercises.&nbsp; Meetings were short, but full of spirit, and persons troubled in mind sought for Christian prayers.&nbsp; A post-office is established in the northern part of the township, at Drake's Mills; and the flourishing town of <a name="Cambridgeboro" href="../../places/Cambridgeboro.html">Cambridge</a>, situated on the French Creek, marks the intersection of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad and the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railroad.&nbsp; The town has five churches, three hotels, a bank, a dozen stores, several liveries, and various industries.&nbsp; Its incorporation as a borough occurred in 1867.&nbsp; A tannery, capable of tanning twelve hundred hides annually, and a handle-factory, operated by B. M. Sherwood & Son, are features of the place.&nbsp; H. N. Rockwell's lath-mill, located one mile north of Cambridge, has a capacity of cutting fifteen thousand lath daily. There was organized in July, 1870, a Masonic lodge at Cambridge.&nbsp; It was known as Cambridge Masonic Lodge.&nbsp; It began with eight charter members, and with H. D. Persons as first W. M.&nbsp; The order has grown rapidly, and includes many of the best citizens in the community.&nbsp; During the school-year ending June 1, 1874, there were in the township eight and one-half schools, which employed fifteen teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 343; average attendance, 280; and total expenditures, $2025.32.&nbsp; These statistics include Cambridge Borough.</blockquote>
