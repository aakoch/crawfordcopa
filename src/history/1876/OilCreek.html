<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oil Creek is the southeast corner township.&nbsp; It was formed in 1820.&nbsp; Its area is eighteen thousand six hundred and seventy-nine acres.&nbsp; Oil and Little Oil Creeks are principal streams.&nbsp; The population, exclusive of Titusville, was, in 1870, two thousand and forty-oneï¿½all white but one.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Among the first settlers in this locality was Jonathan Titus, who came here about 1790.&nbsp; Samuel Kerr arriving soon after, the two men united in the purchase, from the Holland Land Company, of seventeen hundred acres, now embraced in Titusville.&nbsp; A rude shelter was improvised until better could be built.&nbsp;  A house built by Titus, which stood in the rear of the Ralston and Harrington Block, was the first substantial residence in the locality.&nbsp; John Thompson and William Fulton were early settlers at Kerr's Hill.&nbsp; Fulton sold to William Alcorn.&nbsp; Andrew Kerr, who had located on Road 12, bought out Alcorn, and moved to the place bearing his name.&nbsp; James Kerr, son of Andrew, located a five-hundred-acre tract, now owned by Isaac Weed, on Road 18, in 1799.&nbsp; John Gibson, while on his way, in 1800, to French Creek, with a design of settling there, stopped at Oil Creek to fell a tree on which to cross the stream, and accidentally cut his knee.&nbsp; He went back to Hydetown, and stopped with Daniel Titus.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1801, William Gibson, father of John, moved into the township with his family, consisting of his wife and nine children.&nbsp; Thomas Mitchell, of Ireland, accompanied by a family of a wife and four children, moved in on May 6, 1803, and settled on the farm occupied by Joseph Henderson, a grandson.&nbsp; John McIntyre was another of the early settlers.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oil Creek Borough, known as <a name="Hydetown" href="../../places/Hydetown.html">Hydetown</a>, was first settled by Peter and Daniel Titus, brothers to Jonathan.&nbsp; Each took up four hundred acres.&nbsp; The borough is on Oil Creek, three and one-half miles north of Titusville.&nbsp; It was incorporated as a borough in 1869, and is a growing town.&nbsp; The first saw-mill at this point was put up by Charles Ridgway, a settler in 1797, from Fayette County.&nbsp; A store and trading post was established here by Captain Sheffields in 1816.&nbsp; This settlement was on the route pursued by the Indians to their camps at Sandusky, Ohio, and Sheffield bought their furs and sold them goods for some years.&nbsp; Sheffield finally sold out to Joseph S. Chase, son of a Presbyterian minister.&nbsp; The first postmaster was Samuel Kerr, appointed in 1818, and serving ten years.&nbsp; Salaries were such as would not bear reduction.&nbsp; Rev. Amos Chase organized the first church, and it is said of him that he was the founder of over thirty churches in western Pennsylvania.&nbsp; In 1847 there was at Titusville a town of two hundred and seventy-five inhabitants, located in a lumber region.&nbsp; Joseph Care was known as the owner of a grist-mill and saw-mill, a woolen-mill, and machinery for carding and for weaving.&nbsp; Brewer, Watson & Co. were proprietors of a second saw-mill at the place.&nbsp; During this year three commissioners, William Robinson, John M. Titus, and Salmon P. Chase, were appointed to lay off the boundaries of Titusville, and it was incorporated as a borough.

<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The discovery of oil on August 28, 1859, directed public attention to this section, and Titusville became a city of shanty-hotels and fictitious oil companies.&nbsp; The place was incorporated as a city in 1867, and has grown to a population of ten thousand persons.&nbsp; In 1875, one meets upon the outskirts structures of hasty build and aged look, betokening premature and abandoned growth; but, further on, the smell of oil pervades the air, huge tanks are brimmed with oil; tall chimneys exude black clouds of carbon, and nine large refineries are at work, doing a business exceeded only by Cleveland.&nbsp; These refineries are at present manufacturing 17,900 packages per week, distributed as follows:&nbsp; Easterly & Davis, organized 1870, refine 1500 per week; Pickering, Chandler & Co., organized 1868, refine 2400 per week; Acme Works, Porter, Moreland & Co., organized 1867, refine 6500 per week; Octave Oil Co., organized 1872, refine 2200 per week; J. H. Reed, organized 1865, refine 1000 per week; Caddam & Donahue, organized 1865, refine 400 per week; John Jackson, organized 1865, refine 600 per week; J. A. Scott, organized 1868, refine 500 per week; and Bennett, Warner & Co., organized 1870, refine 3000 per week.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eastward, solid business blocks show substantial prosperity.&nbsp; The hills are dotted with residences, and southward, whence comes the oil wealth, the houses extend down the valley.&nbsp; Wide streets are gas-lighted, and paved with wood.&nbsp; Holly Water-Works give property protection from the ravages of fire.&nbsp; A dozen churches show the presence of religious people; costly school structures betoken an interest in education.&nbsp; There is a Board of Trade, an Oil Exchange, and five banking institutions.&nbsp; The "Herald" and "Courier" represent the press. Two large iron works employ hundreds of hands in a variety of manufacture.&nbsp; Hotels are numerous, and grade in quality to the very best.&nbsp; Three railroads enter the city, and furnish transportation to and from the oil region.&nbsp; Wealthy operators are city residents, and expend their means in adorning private residences and public offices.&nbsp; The discovery of wells flowing one hundred and seventy-five barrels per day within three miles of the city, and the gigantic trade in the treasure of the rocks, indicate a lasting and increased prosperity for the city of Titusville.
