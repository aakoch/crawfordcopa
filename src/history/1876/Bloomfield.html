<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the organization of Bloomfield Township it was twelve miles long by six wide, and an original division of the county.&nbsp;  The east half was struck off in 1830 into Sparta, and Bloomfield, as now known, remained.&nbsp;  A man named Cunningham was the first to locate in that territory, 1795.&nbsp; Three years passed, and James Hamilton, agent of John Fields, of Philadelphia, moved in and gave an impetus to the settlement, but in 1808 removed to Meadville.&nbsp;  Prior to 1800 James Bryon, Joseph Kirk, John Taylor, James Winders, Richard Shreve, and the Bloomfields, Lewis, Andrew, and Stephen, moved in and made improvements.&nbsp; 
The pioneer life, devoid of romance was a period of self-denial and years of toil.&nbsp;  Richard Shreve came to Bloomfield in 1798, from Red Stone.&nbsp;  He had a family of thirteen children,�nine sons and four daughters.&nbsp; James Blakeslee was a prominent settler, from Genesee County, New York.&nbsp;  He moved in May, 1819, and in June following his son, Elkanah, joined him.&nbsp;  The Blakeslees located on the Cunningham tract, which they bought of some Swedes who had succeeded the old settler.&nbsp;  The first grist-mill was erected near Oil Creek Lake, in 1800, by James Hamilton, and was repaired and rebuilt in 1821.&nbsp;  One of the first two carding-machines brought into Crawford County was the property of the Shreves,�William and Bargillar,�who ran it for two seasons.&nbsp; Bloomfield has a small little village and three hamlets within its borders.&nbsp; <a name="Riceville" href="../../places/Riceville.html">Riceville</a> is upon Oil Creek, and is a 
station on the Union and Titusville Railroad.&nbsp;  It derives its name from Samuel Rice, who erected the first house upon its site.&nbsp;  In 1830 the first saw-mill was built in Riceville.&nbsp;  It now contains two churches, a hotel, stores, shops, factories, a school building, and over three hundred inhabitants.&nbsp;  Chapinville is on the Rockdale line.&nbsp;  Bloomfield is named after the family referred to.&nbsp;  Lincolnville is near the south central part of the township.&nbsp;  It was named after Seth Lincoln, who, in December, 1837, took up a four-hundred-acre tract on its site, and thereon cut the first tree, and erected the first saw- and grist-mills.&nbsp;  The saw-mill, repaired, is still in use, but the grist-mill has fallen into disuse.&nbsp;  In 1838 Salmon N. Sturdevant joined Mr. Lincoln, and has been a leading citizen for the many subsequent years.&nbsp;  The township contains thirty-nine thousand four hundred and 
sixty-five acres.&nbsp;  Oil Creek traverses its central portion, receiving several tributaries.&nbsp;  About the centre of the township the creek expands and forms a lake.&nbsp;  The leading occupation of residents are lumbering and dairying.&nbsp;  The Union and Titusville Railroad extends along the valley of Oil Creek through the township.
