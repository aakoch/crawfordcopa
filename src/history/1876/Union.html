<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Union was organized in October, 1867, from adjacent portions of Vernon, Fairfield, and Greenwood.&nbsp; It is bounded on the south and west by Conneaut Outlet, which has been a marshy waste.&nbsp; Dredging has been done and is continued with good results, reclaiming large areas of the most fertile lands.&nbsp; David Mumford, Tunis Elson, John McFadden, and Matthew Wilson were the pioneers of the township as early as 1795.&nbsp; Wilson located on the run which bears his name.&nbsp; McFadden settled on the outlet of Conneaut marsh, north side.&nbsp; Theodore Scowden, James Burchfield, and James Smith were immigrants to Union in 1805.&nbsp; Leonard Smock, from New Jersey, settled about the same time just north of the outlet.&nbsp; Other settlers of later date were Joseph Thatcher, Daniel Holton, Peter Rebert, Francis Stein, Daniel Hammon and Mr. Huber.&nbsp; Mrs. Abigail Mumford was three months in her new home in Union before she saw the face of another white woman.&nbsp; The first apples and peaches raised in the county were probably grown on the farm of David Mumford. Abraham Williams was born in 1804, and Cornelius Smock in 1806.&nbsp; The marriage of John Williams to Margaret Mumford, in 1802, is of the first.&nbsp; Wilson erected a small corn-cracker mill on Wilson's Run, but milling was done at Peterson's mill in Greenwood, one mile north of Custard's Post Office.&nbsp; James Smith built the first saw-mill, and was the first Justice; he carried on work at times in a blacksmith shop, built for home and neighbors' convenience.&nbsp; Theodore and Hiram Powers kept the first store, at the pike crossing of the Old Beaver Canal. William Birchfield kept public house at Dutch Hill Post Office.&nbsp; The first school-house stood on land now owned by Thatcher; the next, a frame, was at Dutch Hill.&nbsp; Jonathan Phillips was the first teacher therein.&nbsp; The first Methodist class in Crawford County was formed in Union at the house of Mr. Mumford, he being the first class-leader.&nbsp; Meetings continued to be held there for thirty years.&nbsp; The pioneer church was erected on the State road in 1837.&nbsp; It was of logs, and was converted to a frame building by William Stett in 1854.&nbsp; The first pastors of Mount Pleasant Church, M.E., were John Leech and H. Kinsley.&nbsp; Their society organized in 1826, with twelve members.&nbsp; To realize the difficulties attending the work of clearing in the days of first settlement, the character of implements should be understood.&nbsp; The plow of that day had a wooden mould-board with a wrought iron share and coulter.&nbsp; The harrow was the fork of a tree and wooden teeth. Iron was dear and blacksmiths few.&nbsp; Wagons were seldom seen, and it is said Daniel Holton, in 1815, drove the first team into Meadville.&nbsp; Sleds with wooden soles were used to gather in the harvest and to go to mill.&nbsp; Cattle were preferred to horses.&nbsp; Browsing was a resort in winter.&nbsp; Settlers went to the woods in the morning, and with axes cut the maple- and linden-trees, and the cattle ate the extremities of the branches.&nbsp; In summer wood-pasture was excellent.&nbsp; The pea-vine, with delicate tendril and tiny pod, and the wild bean supplied a sweet and nutritious food.
