<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This township dates original formation to 1811.&nbsp; During the survey of this locality in 1795, the camp of William Power was visited by Indians, who captured James Thompson, in charge at the time, and robbed the camp.&nbsp; Thompson escaped.&nbsp; The first settler was Hugh Fletcher, of Ireland. His daughter Sarah, born in 1798, was the first female white child native to the township of Shenango.&nbsp; Robert McComahey and James Davis, from Ireland, and Michael Marshall, from Lancaster, came in 1797.&nbsp; Robert Bennett settled in 1798 on the farm occupied by his son Samuel.&nbsp; James Dickey arrived in 1799, and for a gun, powder-horn, and blanket bought one hundred acres of John Grimes.&nbsp; John Gallagher took up land on Tract 810 in the year 1800.&nbsp; Solomon Dowlhott, John Nevins, and John Mullian were settlers in 1801.&nbsp; The first gris-mill was built on Shenango Creek in 1830 by John Clyde, and the first saw-mill in 1842 by William Lewis; both have long since gone down.&nbsp; The primal school was taught by Edward Hatton, an old man, and very popular as a teacher.&nbsp; The school was in a round-log house which stood on land now owned by William McArthur.&nbsp; The oldest church organization dates to 1801, when the United Presbyterian Church of Shenango was formed by Rev. Daniel McLean, with ten members.&nbsp; The first services were held in a tent, next in a log house built in 1805, and finally, in the church erected in 1818, and located one mile north of the State road.&nbsp; At this church is the oldest grave-yard within some distance.&nbsp; John Marshall, still living, and when visited, engaged in cutting up corn, affirms himself to be the oldest native in the township, giving as his birthday August 3, 1798.&nbsp; William Bennett was second, and Polly Fletcher the third, all during the same month and year.&nbsp; The climate may be deemed salubrious, judging from the advanced age reached by many.&nbsp; The first threshing-machine used in the township was brought in by Mr. Baily, who thrashed for Robert Story.&nbsp; Neighbors gathered to see the novelty, and discarding the flail, gave Bailey all that he could do.
