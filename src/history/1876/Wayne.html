<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the pioneers to Wayne, Henry Bean, of German origin, settled on 
what is known as the McCune farm.&nbsp; McCune and Bean's father-in-law had come in at the same time, and earlier.&nbsp; The land was but sparsely occupied till 1800, when the Medills,�John and Hugh,�located on the Oil Creek Road.&nbsp; The Brawleys,�Hugh and James,�and others settled on the flat, near Frenchtown.&nbsp; James D. Allen and Mr. Wheeling settled in 1819.&nbsp; Francis McDaniels moved in about 1822.&nbsp; William Record arriving in 1824, found few neighbors near by; and Jacob Rees, from Philadelphia, came to Wayne in 1829, and located on the site of Deckardsville.&nbsp; The place, covered with trees, gave no indication of a future town; and, like many another, Rees found it necessary to clear his way with the axe.&nbsp; It is asserted, and is probably a fact, that James Ferry alone killed eighteen bears and eight hundred deer in the vicinity of Sugar Lake; and when the number engaged in hunting is realized, the abundance of game becomes a matter of wonder.&nbsp; The first school-house in Wayne stood on the land of James Cochran.&nbsp; Among early marriages was that of Squire Johnson to Elizabeth Elsworth, in 1812.&nbsp; A powder-mill was built and run by Henry Heath in an early day.&nbsp; His material was brought from Pittsburgh.&nbsp;  About the year 1810 a saw- and grist-mill was run by Holmes & Harriet, on Sugar Creek.&nbsp; The village of <a name="Deckards">Deckardsville is on Decker's Run, four miles east of Cochranton; besides other healthy indications, the place contains three churches.&nbsp; The township was organized in 1811 [<i>sic</i>; should be 1809].&nbsp; In shape it resembles a right-angled triangle, with its hypotenuse a succession of right angles, bordering upon Venango County.&nbsp; Sugar Lake is a small lake in the northern part, and an expansion of a creek of the same name.&nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1464, and its area is twenty thousand and sixty-six acres.
