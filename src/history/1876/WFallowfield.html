<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The township of West Fallowfield was formed in 1845.&nbsp; Its area is six thousand six hundred and twenty-nine acres.&nbsp; The surface is uneven, and sustains a heavy growth of pine, oak, and chestnut.&nbsp; Crooked Creek is the boundary line on the east.&nbsp; The oldest Justice of the Peace was Hugh Andrews, appointed at an early date, and held for life.&nbsp; An early marriage was of William Henry to Nancy Rankin, on March 7, 1807.&nbsp; Hugh Fletcher was chain-carrier to the surveyors of this region, and settled during 1797 in the north part of the township.&nbsp; Among the early settlers of the strip of land known as West Fallowfield, were Thomas and George McClellan, Adam Owry, a Revolutionary soldier, and his brother John, made simple by injuries received while running the gauntlet among the Indians, and Samuel Rogers.&nbsp; William Henry, from Fayette County, with knapsack on his back and rifle in hand, came out in 1800 to seek a home, and located just west of Hartstown.&nbsp; While heads of numerous families were seekers for new homes, it is remarkable in the early settlement of Crawford that a large number of her pioneers were young men, single. Henry's first cover was a shelter supported by forked sticks, and roofed with bark.&nbsp; He next built a pole hut, and, being unable to make a door, cut a hole in a log near the top, through which he used to crawl in and out.&nbsp; The general first crop was potatoes.&nbsp; Henry and Owry built the first hewed-log houses.&nbsp; The first raising was of Thomas McLanahan's double hewed-log barn.&nbsp; It was raised in 1810, and destroyed by fire in 1818.&nbsp; The first saw-mill stood a mile east of Adamsville, and was built by McClellan.&nbsp; William Campbell erected the first grist-mill, a mile south of the same village.&nbsp; Henry was the first tanner west of Meadville.&nbsp; His first tanning was of a horse-skin, and the skin of a calf partly eaten by wolves, done in a dug-out trough.&nbsp; Next season, vats were made lined with puncheon.&nbsp; A tannery was built in 1806, and burnt by incendiary in 1818.&nbsp; During twelve years work has been abundant.&nbsp; Another tannery was erected in 1819, and still stands on the Henry farm on the State road.&nbsp; Work was done in the building as late as 1872.&nbsp; Home distilling was common, and seven stills were in operation at one time.&nbsp; The first store was kept at Hart's Corners by Cyrus T. Cummings, who boarded with Henry.&nbsp; Adam Owry was the pioneer blacksmith, and followed the trade till his death.&nbsp; His shop was at Adamsville, a village in the southern part of the township.&nbsp; Pioneer schools were kept in abandoned cabins.&nbsp; <a name="Hartstown" href="../../places/Hartstown.html">Hartstown</a> is located north of the centre of the township.&nbsp; It owes its name to James and William Hart, brothers and landowners in the vicinity.&nbsp; Dr. Steen built the second structure and the first hewed-log house in the place.&nbsp; The next was by Thomas Rogers, the village "smithy."&nbsp; The pioneer merchant was John McFarn, who wagoned his goods from Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Squire Henry, Jr., was the first resident carpenter.&nbsp; La Fevre was the first landlord in Hartsville, in a house built by Hart.&nbsp; Ezra Buell was a teacher prior to 1822, in a house on the village-site.&nbsp; Teachers were wanted, and Buell was called upon to teach a school when in his eighty-fourth year.&nbsp; The old pedagogue lived to be nearly a century old, and was buried in the village cemetery.&nbsp; Hartstown was incorporated in 1851.&nbsp; A reservoir covering six hundred acres was a favorite fishing resort.&nbsp; The water was let off in 1872, and large quantities of bass, white-fish, and pickerel were taken by the villagers and farmers of the vicinity.
