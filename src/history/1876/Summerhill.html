<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Summer Hill Township was formed from Beaver and Cussewago in 1830.&nbsp; In area it has fourteen thousand six hundred and three acres, is situated west of the centre of the County, and is well watered by Conneaut Creek and its many tributaries.&nbsp; Along the valley of Conneaut Creek are seen the old basin, the decaying locks, and the old tow-path of the Beaver and Erie Canal.&nbsp; The close of canal navigation staggered the growth of towns along its path; and a sense of age and ruin is felt by one who saw the canal in its prosperity.&nbsp; Portions of the canal are utilized as dams, and mills are run by power thus generated.&nbsp; The first township election was held in the log house of Benjamin Bearfield, now owned by J. A. Davenport.&nbsp; James McDowell, Jr., was the first Justice appointed, and held the office many years.&nbsp; Henry B. Beatty was probably the next.&nbsp; Settlers came in few in the first years and at wide intervals, but increased annually, as the facilities of roads and subsistence were augmented.&nbsp; After a previous survey in 1795, James McDowell, wife, and children, and Daniel Myers moved from the region of the Susquehanna by slow stages, and established a home on the Conneaut Creek, in this township.&nbsp; In their train came John Sterling and family, old neighbors, and settled on a farm adjoining McDowell.&nbsp; About the year 1800, a young man named James Fetterman came into the woods, and went resolutely to work.&nbsp; In time he erected a hewed-log house, the best in the township, and finally became the owner of over one thousand acres of land, and a leading citizen.&nbsp; The arrival of Jacob LeFevre and a recently married wife next occurred, and the bridal tour was a journey to a forest home.&nbsp; Next came John McTier, a stone mason by trade, and many a stone chimney was laid by his hands.&nbsp; during the fall and winter of 1798 and '99, Indians camped near the white settlements, and supplied the settlers with meat.&nbsp; This region was then a favorite hunting land, and every little stream has known their encampments.&nbsp; The warriors, especially the older men, were taciturn and sullen and cherished malevolent feelings, and many a family living alone in the woods and helpless were affrighted by the sudden appearance of Indians.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A frame house was not erected in the township till 1829, when Alexander McDowell built the first and John McDowell the second.&nbsp; The first frame barn had been raised in 1822 by John Douglas for Fetterman.&nbsp; People came to the raising from some distance; they went heartily to their task, and enjoying good liquor and an abundant supper, dispersed homeward.&nbsp; It is remembered that Samuel Steel, an Irishman, taught school in 1814, and boarding around, was accustomed to cobble for the families at evening.&nbsp; Unluckily the school-house caught fire, and his kit of tools was consumed.&nbsp; The first roads were made by voluntary co-operation of the settlers, and were of the rudest type.&nbsp; In the year 1824, two brothers, Michael and John Winger, built the first saw-mill upon Conneaut Creek, on the Winger farm.&nbsp; It has long since gone to decay.&nbsp; The first grist-mill was set in operation near what is now called Dicksonburg, by George Dickson, as late as 1830.&nbsp; The only tannery in the township was carried on by Francis Maguire.&nbsp; The establishment stood on the farm of John May, and the proprietor took half the leather for payment.&nbsp; John McDowell erected the first distillery, and James Fetterman the second.&nbsp; The latter did an extensive business for that day, and his liquors were mainly for home consumption.&nbsp; There were no taverns in the township, but hospitality was the rule.&nbsp; Wherever in journeying night came on the traveler, the first cabin-door was opened to him, and a table spread with such as they had,�generally wheat or corn-bread, mush and milk, vegetables, and a scanty supply of meat.&nbsp; Milk was the daily substitute for tea and coffee.&nbsp; An early marriage was that of John McDowell to Margaret Nelson, in 1798.&nbsp; The birth of Jane McDowell, in July, 1800, was among the first.&nbsp; There was not a settled physician, and the services of Dr. Wood, of Conneautville, were most available.&nbsp; The primal school-house stood on the farm of Washington Sterling.&nbsp; It was built about 1812, of round logs.&nbsp; The teacher was named Triford Rudd.&nbsp; The McDowell burial-ground is the oldest in the township.&nbsp; The first to occupy it was James McDowell.&nbsp; William McDaniels, millwright by trade, performed the offices of the undertaker.&nbsp; Coffins were made of cherry, with raised lid, and were the result of considerable labor.&nbsp; <a name="Dicksonburg">Dicksonburg, formerly called Dickson's Mills, is a village located in the southwest part of the township.&nbsp; Here, on the bank of the canal, John P. Thompson opened the first grocery store.&nbsp; A cheese-factory was established here in 1872 by Hugh and Hiram Hammond.&nbsp; An extensive business is done.&nbsp; Fifteen cheeses, averaging about fifty pounds, are made daily, and on the 18th of September, 1875, nine tons of their July make of cheese were shipped to a New York commission house.&nbsp; There are at present in Crawford County sixty-eight factories, producing 6,310,000 pounds of cheese.&nbsp; The population of Summer Hill is to a considerable extent of New England origin, Republican in politics, and interested in education.&nbsp; The township has 10 schools, 19 teachers, an average attendance of 207, and a percentage of 90.&nbsp; Total expenditures, $2,275,93.
