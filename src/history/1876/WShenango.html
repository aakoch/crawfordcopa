<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;West Shenango was formed from South Shenango on August 14, 1863.&nbsp; Peter Royal, Jeremiah Yokes, B. Snodgrass, Thomas Loughey, and Robert French were the pioneer settlers, about the year 1800.&nbsp; Andrew Betts and his son John were the first to make settlement; the former built the first hewed- log house in that section, and the latter began the first clearing on the farm now owned by Henry Betts, on Road 6.&nbsp; Not long after his arrival, Betts erected a small grist-mill, with a capacity for neighborhood grinding.&nbsp; Water was furnished by a spring bearing their name.&nbsp; On the completion of the State road, Betts also erected a saw-mill.&nbsp; No store till the establishment of one at the present village of Turnersville, in the east part of the township, founded by one Turner, who, following advice, laid out a town; failed to sell lots, and finally settlement began.&nbsp; Charles Davis was the first storekeeper and Postmaster, and sold to Peter Royal.&nbsp; John Betts was the pioneer preacher, and expounded the doctrines and faith of Methodism.&nbsp; The first organization occurred in 1819, with fourteen members.&nbsp; Rev. E. Morse was the preacher in charge, and the society was known as the State Line Methodist Episcopal Church.&nbsp; Edward Hatton is regarded as the teacher of the first school, on the place now owned by his son, Leonard Hatton.&nbsp; First marriage was that of Francis Royal to Elizabeth White.&nbsp; John Ralston was the first resident doctor at Turnersville.&nbsp; Andrew Betts was the first to die, and, as was the semi- barbarous but unavoidable custom, he was buried on the farm.&nbsp; One among many marked changes is that of transition from the scattered grave-yards alone, or about a church, to the tasteful cemetery and enduring monument: not that grief was less nor disposition altered, but from the ability which convenience gives.
