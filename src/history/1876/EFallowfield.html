<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;East Fallowfield was formed in 1804.&nbsp; It contains sixteen thousand six hundred and sixteen acres.&nbsp; The surface is hilly.&nbsp; The Atlantic and Great Western Railroad passes southwardly through near the centre of the township.&nbsp; Atlantic, a station on the road, is a thriving and growing place.&nbsp; Thomas Frame and Daniel Miller were pioneers of the township.&nbsp; In 1798, three settlers moved in:&nbsp; Thomas Smith, Thomas McMichael, and Abraham Jackson.&nbsp; Daniel Dipple, from Cumberland County, moved in during 1800, and settled near Smith and McMichael, in the north part of the township.&nbsp; His death, on November 20, 1811, is given as the first in the town.&nbsp; In 1801, John McEntire, of Scotland, emigrated to East Fallowfield, and took up a large tract of land, and in 1803 John Andrews settled upon a four-hundred-acre tract in the northwest part of the township near the settlers first named.&nbsp; These simple records from information by surviving pioneers or their children, telling of early settlers, thrill not with narrative of deadly peril and dangerous journeyings, yet there is a heroism�though not written�which marks the name of him who came to Crawford at an early day, as worthy of remembrance; and while we laud the soldier who followed the shot-pierced flag in headlong rush upon the enemy, we justly admire the pioneers scattered in the dense woods of Crawford, felling the forest with ringing axe, raising cabins, clearing land, planting orchards, building roads, and caring for spiritual needs and future influence by the organization of churches and the support of schools, and laying a broad foundation upon which is built the permanent prosperity of the present generation.&nbsp; As a partial payment of the present to the past, the child to his ancestor, herein is recorded as a roll of honor the name of the founders of the county of Crawford.
