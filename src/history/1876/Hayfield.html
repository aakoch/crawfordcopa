<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The history of this township is furnished by Joseph Dickson, now in his eighty-sixth year and the oldest early settler in Crawford County.&nbsp; The township was organized in the year 1830.&nbsp; Its situation is northwest of the centre of the County, and its surface embraces an area of twenty-two thousand six hundred and forty-one acres.&nbsp; French Creek is the eastern boundary, and Cussewago flows through its lands in a southward course.&nbsp; James Dickson was the pioneer settler of the township.&nbsp; In the spring of 1793, he left his home near Pittsburgh and traveled on foot to Meadville, then a hamlet of two or three small log cabins; thence he went up the creek till he found a satisfactory location on the west side of what are known as Magoffin's Falls.&nbsp; Here he made a tomahawk improvement, as the early settlers were wont to do,�that is, he deadened a few trees and marked others by cuttings in the bark.&nbsp; This act gave no legal rights, but was respected by the settlers as establishing a priority of claim, with which it was discreditable to interfere.&nbsp; These "rights" were bought by purchasers of favorite tracts rather than quarrel with the claimants.&nbsp; Dickson worked in company with a man named William Jones from east of the creek, and raised a supply of corn and potatoes.&nbsp; As winter approached he returned to Pittsburgh, and passed that season in preparation, and, in the spring of 1794, brought his family up French Creek in a keel-boat to Meadville.&nbsp; Dread of the Indians prevented improvement; but in 1796 that fear was removed, and the family of seven persons moved to the future farm.&nbsp; By kindly aid, a log cabin was constructed, the clearing was enlarged, and upon a portion a young orchard was set out.&nbsp; He was not without neighbors.&nbsp; Roderick Frazer, a Scotchman, settled about a mile down the creek; William Gill as far up the stream; and beyond Gill was the cabin of Hugh Logue, an Irishman.&nbsp; In 1797, three brothers named Mason,�David, George, and Isaac,�moved in, and the Brookhousers came about this time to Woodcock Township.&nbsp; The nucleus of settlement being formed, people came in for a few years very fast, and the County gave unmistakable evidences of occupation. James Irvin had a farm near Dunn, and Conrad Cole was located on the Cussewago.&nbsp; Along the east side of French Creek was the old road to Le Boeuf.&nbsp; To this road each settler cut a pathway, and upon it made his trips to Meadville.&nbsp; The first road built was the Cussewago trace.&nbsp; George Mason built a little mill for grinding on Foster's Run, about a mile and a half northwest of Saegertown, in 1800.&nbsp; It was the first in the township.&nbsp; A fulling-mill was built lower down on the same run by Frederick Hickernell; some years later, William Foster erected a saw-mill on the bank of French Creek.&nbsp; The water was brought from Foster's Run by a race, and gave a fall of fifteen feet.&nbsp; Distilleries were started by both Dickson and Gill in the year 1814.&nbsp; Their capacity was equal to about four bushels of rye daily, and they were the only ones in the township.&nbsp;  Dickson, aided by his son, Joseph, built a grist-mill in 1815 at Magoffin's Falls.&nbsp; One Magoffin had cleared a miil-site, but never built upon it, and the place was given his name.&nbsp; Jacob Bailor was the pioneer blacksmith, and had a shop southeast of Coon's Corners.&nbsp; Henry Ricard was the next, and located west of the Corners on the Cussewago road; both were Teutons and valuable assistants in the work of clearing the new farms.&nbsp; Sharpening the plow-points was a leading occupation of those days.&nbsp; Taverns were not known in the township.&nbsp; Dickson built a bridge across French Creek in 1815.&nbsp; It was the first in the township, and was called after the builder,�Dickson's Bridge.&nbsp; It had stone piers and hewed timbers, and was of great utility.&nbsp; In time, the bridge was purchased by the County.&nbsp; Three bridges now connect with Woodcock Township; the one at Saegertown is substantially built of iron.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The medical services of Dr. Kennedy were all that were had for years.&nbsp; The first school was kept during the winter of 1798 and ' 99 by Martha Owry, in her cabin.&nbsp; It numbered about a score of pupils.&nbsp; Years sometimes passed without schools.&nbsp; Among the first school-houses was a small frame, erected about 1830, on the Dickson farm.&nbsp; The first white child born in the limits of the township was probably William Dickson, in 1797, and the first Justice appointed was, so far as known, James Dunn.
