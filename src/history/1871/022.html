</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="county"></a>Crawford County received its name in honor of <a name=”1”></a>Wm. Crawford, one of the participants and heroes of the Western frontier, who was burned by the Indians at Sandusky.&nbsp; It was taken from Allegheny County by an Act of March the 12th, 1800.&nbsp; The County is 41 miles in length, breadth 24 miles, containing an area of 974 square miles, or 633,360 acres.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; So far as history will enlighten us, the first white men whose feet pressed the soil of Crawford County, were undoubtedly the French.&nbsp; In 1748 and &#146;58, they attempted to extend their chain of Posts from Presque-Isle and Leb&#156;uf, one of the sources of the Venango River, to the Allegheny, and thus control the waters of the Ohio.&nbsp; As regards this County, they were only birds of passage, they having no motive to form any permanent establishment here.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="waterways"></a>Venango River, (or commonly called French Creek), enters from Erie County, meandering centrally through the County, passes through a corner of Mercer into Venango County, emptying into the Allegheny at Franklin.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Several other small streams water the County, viz: Cussewago, Big and Little Sugar Creeks, Oil Creek, Woodcock Creek, Muddy Creek and Conneaut Creek.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; There are three handsome Lakes in the County.&nbsp; Conneaut is a beautiful sheet of water, about 4&#189; miles by 2&#189; miles, abounding with fine fish, and is now a favorite resort for the angler and sportsman.&nbsp; This Lake is noted for its double white pond lilies, peculiar, we believe, to the American Continent, springing from the bottom of the Lake; they expand their flowers when they reach the surface and sunshine.&nbsp; The other two are of smaller size, but equally picturesque and beautiful.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1789, <a name="1"></a>David Mead and a few adventurous spirits with him, visited the valley of French Creek with the design of settlement.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Mead located three tracts, called in the Patent &#147;Meadville,&#148; &#147;Mill Tract&#148; and &#147;Cussewago Island.&#148;&nbsp; His first residence was on the site of <a name="2"></a>James E. McFarland&#146;s present dwelling.&nbsp; It was then picketed for protection from hostile Indians.&nbsp; He afterwards built at the head of Water St., where <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>23</b>&gt;</font> he died in 1816.&nbsp; Mr. Mead was the first Commissioned Justice north of Pittsburgh; he was one of the first Associate Judges, and held other offices, civil and military.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Block-house, for the protection of the first settlers, was built on the corner of Water St. and Steers&#146;s Alley.&nbsp;  It was removed in 1828, having served for the uses of the earliest school, a carpenter shop, blacksmith shop, and the residence of families in varied succession.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The triangular lot, on which it stood, was given by Mr. Mead to the citizens of Meadville for a common school, and by deed vested in Trustees, it was afterwards, by Legislative enactment, transferred to the Meadville Female Seminary with power to sell, and was by the Trustees sold to <a name="3"></a>Thomas Wilson.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Water St. occupies the site of the ancient Indian path from Fort Venango to Fort Le B&#156;uf, in the days of the French occupancy.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="4"></a>Washington, in Dec. 1753, carried dispatches from <a name="5"></a>Gov. Dinwiddie, of Virginia, to the French Commandant at Fort Leb&#156;uf, remonstrating against encroachment on the territorial rights of Britain.&nbsp; He speaks in his journal of the extensive flats of meadow land in our valley, but of a future Meadville he had no prophetic vision.&nbsp; The 10 years which closed the 18th century witnessed the advent of many settlers into this region; the valleys and the navigable streams were the first choice, as no roads existed, and by water was the only means of transportation.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The original plan of Meadville was conceived in 1790, but was matured and much enlarged by <a name="6"></a>Maj. Alden and <a name="7"></a>Doctor Kennedy in 1795.&nbsp; The first Church, Presbyterian, was organized about the year 1800, and <a name="8"></a>Rev. Jos. Stockton settled as the pastor.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first paper published in Northwestern Pennsylvania was the <i>Crawford Messenger</i>, issued at Meadville by <a name="9"></a>T. Atkinson, Esq.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Meadville was incorporated as a Borough March 29, 1823, on the 16th of June following by the election of Thomas Atkinson, Burgess, <a name="10"></a>Eliphalet Betts, <a name="11"></a>James Hamilton, <a name="12"></a>Jos. Patterson, <a name="13"></a>Daniel Perkins and <a name="14"></a>George Seldon, Council.&nbsp; In 1835 the Borough Charter was so amended that two Councilmen were elected annually to serve for three years.&nbsp; In 1838 the Charter was again amended by creating the office of Ass&#146;t Burgess, and Jno. Dick was elected to that position.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1853 the Legislature was petitioned for the privilege of extending the Boro. boundaries, which being granted, the limits were fixed and remained so until the City Charter was obtained.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The 15th of February, 1866, a new Charter was granted by the Legislature <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>24</b>&gt;</font> and Meadville became an incorporated City with <a name="15"></a>Wm. Reynolds, Esq., as Mayor.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1816 the population was estimated at about 400.&nbsp; The census returns from time to time show a gratifying increase.&nbsp; The population in 1840 was 1,319; 1850, 2,578; 1860, 3,702; 1870, &#151;.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The City is pleasantly located in a beautiful valley on the east side of Venango River, (French Creek) surrounded by hills, which rise in gentle undulations on the east side, and afford desirable sites for residences, and fine grounds, and in every direction the landscape is unsurpassed for natural beauty and varied scenery.&nbsp; The City is unsurpassed in healthfulness by any in the Union, and, except in winter, very few pleasanter places can be found.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The public buildings and many private residences are of the first-class of Architecture, and few interior towns can boast of so many costly and tasteful dwellings.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Fine brick blocks have risen where, only a few years ago, the trade of the place was carried on in cheap, old-fashioned, wooden structures.&nbsp; Since 1860, Meadville has almost trebled in wealth and population, and the coming season bids fair to rival any of the past in good, substantial, business Blocks, of the most creditable character.

<br>&#151;&#151;</center>
</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; Comparatively few of the citizens of Meadville of to-day, know anything of the old time history of the place and its early settlers.&nbsp; Our venerable and esteemed townsman, <a name="16"></a>Jno. Reynolds, Esq., has kindly furnished us with the names of those who were here in 1805.&nbsp; Mr. Reynolds was then going to school to <a name="17"></a>Rev. Jos.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jail was a log building on the ground of <a name="74"></a>Thomas Braggins&#146;s residence, opposite the Eagle Hotel.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the land on which the City stands was, in 1805, covered with a <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>26</b>&gt;</font> heavy growth of forest trees, or but recently cleared.&nbsp; <a name="75"></a>Mr. Reynolds had in his possession until recently, a hand-bill signed by the real estate owners of the village, setting forth in the advantages of Meadville as a point, and holding out inducements to persons at a distance to locate here.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The lots were offered at six dollars each, and were chiefly located on those portions of Water, Chestnut, Center, Walnut, and Dock Streets, which are now most densely populated.

<br>&#151;&#151;</center>
</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the fall of 1862 the Atlantic & Great Western Railway&#151;the connecting link of the broad gauge between New York and St. Louis&#151;was completed to Meadville, and shortly afterwards the Franklin Branch Railway was extended to Oil City, giving the vast Oil Fields its first outlet by Railway.&nbsp;  On the 1st of January, 1869 the entire Railway with its branches passed into the hands of the Erie R&#146;y under a twelve years&#146; lease.&nbsp; Under the active management of the Assistant General Superintendent, <a name="76"></a>O. S. Lyford, vast improvements are being made, the passenger and freight traffic being larger than any previous year, with a steady increase.&nbsp;  There are at this place, built of brick, large work shops and engine houses, which with the houses belonging to the Co., and rented by employees cover an area of sixty acres.
<br>
<br>
<center><a name="Allegheny"></a><font size="+2">Allegheny College.
<br>&#151;&#151;</center>
</font> &nbsp; &nbsp; Allegheny College, which is situated upon a beautiful piece of elevated ground northward of the city, overlooking the valley and surrounding hills, had its origin in a meeting of the intelligent citizens of Meadville, held June 20th, 1815.&nbsp; The leading spirit in this enterprise in behalf of education was the <a name="77"></a>Rev. Timothy Alden, D. D., who became its first President.&nbsp; It was mainly due to his exertions that the means were raised for the erection of the main building, which took place in 1816-17.&nbsp; The institution was opened on the 4th of July, 1816, although the act of incorporation was not passed by the Legislature until March 24th, 1817, when the sum of $2,000 was granted by the State, which was subsequently increased to $7,000.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The very valuable library which the institution possesses was obtained mainly by the untiring zeal of Mr. Alden, who performed one or more tours through the Eastern States to solicit aid from learned and benevolent indi-<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>27</b>&gt;</font>viduals for his infant seminary.&nbsp; The most liberal contributor was the <a name="78"></a>Rev. Dr. Bentley, a Unitarian clergyman, of Salem, Mass., who had spent his life in amassing one of the rarest collections of theological works in the country.&nbsp; Harvard University had set her eyes upon this collection, and having bestowed a preliminary <i>plum</i>, in the shape of an L.L. D. Diploma, patiently awaited the Doctor&#146;s demise.&nbsp; She occupied, however, the situation of Esau before Isaac, for Mr. Alden had previously &#147;prepared the savory dish, and received the boon.&#148;&nbsp; The portrait of Dr. Bentley still adorns the walls of the Hall of Allegheny Literacy Society.&nbsp; The valuable private libraries of <a name="79"></a>Hon. Judge Winthrop and <a name="80"></a>Isaiah Thomas, Esq., also both of Massachusetts, were added soon after to the College Library through the influence of Mr. Alden, the former being valued at the time at $6,500.&nbsp; But notwithstanding these and other liberal endowments, the College, which commenced its existence as a Presbyterian institution, languished.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Its more successful rivals for Presbyterian support at Carlisle, Canonsburg and Washington, drew so largely upon the patronage which that denomination at that early day was able to bestow, that President Alden was obliged to abandon the work upon which his heart had been largely set, and which, up to 1833, had been carried forward almost solely through his indomitable energy and perseverance.&nbsp; In 1829 an attempt was made to institute a military school at the College, but it proved unsuccessful.&nbsp; In 1833 the College was transferred to the care and patronage of the Erie and Pittsburgh Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and has since been in an exceedingly flourishing condition.

<br><center><a name="manufactories"></a><font size="+2">Manufacturing Interests.
<br>&#151;&#151;
<br></font>MEADVILLE WOOLEN MILLS.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no Manufacturing establishment in Meadville, which has enjoyed more notoriety&#151;which has seen more of the great and small things in business, or upon which has been expended more mechanical and business ability, than the Meadville Woolen Mills.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The works are owned and managed by our esteemed townsmen, <a name="87"></a>H. S. & <a name="88"></a>F. W. Huidekoper.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The mill is now making double and twist Cassimeres for the New York, Philadelphia and Boston markets, in each of which Cities their goods are sold, in competition with the Harris and Blackington Cassimeres.&nbsp; For their extensive home trade, they make an endless variety of Fancy Cassimeres, Flannels and Blankets.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Office, Salesroom, and Wool Room, are in a three-story brick building, on Chestnut St., and in the rear, fronting on Center, are the Mill and adjoining buildings.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The arrangements of the Mill are complete; the machinery is new and of the best, and not a machine is wanting to make it a first-class manufactory.&nbsp; An average of 75 hands are employed, with an aggregate pay-roll of $40,000 per annum.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The production is about 5,000 yards of &#190; goods per week; the yearly production reaching about $250,000. 
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<center>MEADVILLE AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKS.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This large establishment, located upon the southern border of the city on the line of the railroad, was established December 29, 1868, under the Act of the Legislature of the State, entitled &#147;An Act relating to Corporations for Mechanical, Manufacturing, Mining, and Quarrying purposes,&#148;  approved July 18, 1863, by a company composed chiefly of enterprising citizens of <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>29</b>&gt;</font> Meadville, and is devoted to the manufacture of Agricultural Implements.&nbsp; The capital invested is $100,000.&nbsp; It employs about 70 hands&#151;the last monthly pay-roll exceeding $2,600.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The business during the present year is the manufacture of the &#147;Atlantic&#148; and &#147;Kniffen&#148; Mower and Reaper, of which five are turned out daily.&nbsp; This Company are the sole manufacturers of the &#147;Atlantic&#148; Mower, which is considered one of the best machines made.&nbsp; As a reaper of side delivery it is acknowledged to have no superior.&nbsp; During the coming year the Company expect to make a Hay-loader, Rake, and other implements, in addition to their Mowers and Reapers.&nbsp; The short time the Works have been in operation makes it impossible to give the exact yearly production, but we are pleased to record the fact that their business has been steadily on the increase since going into operation, and it is confidently expected to double or treble during the coming year.
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<center>DICK FOUNDRY AND MACHINE WORKS.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no manufacturing establishment in Meadville that commands more respect or, upon which has been expended more mechanical and business ability than Dick Foundry and Machine Works.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The former member of the firm, <a name="89"></a>David Dick, Esq., has the reputation as an inventor which is world-wide;  as a gentleman of profound scientific attainments he has few equals.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The works were established in 1864, by the former firm, <a name="90"></a>Dick, Fisk & Co., (now <a name="91"></a>Dick & Co.) and is located near the south end of Water St., on the railroad.&nbsp; The whole works have the capacity for the employment of 30 to 40 hands.&nbsp; Five tons daily, or 600 tons of metal are consumed annually.&nbsp; Castings of all kinds are manufactured, including Railroad, Rolling Mill and Coal-bank Castings, and almost every description of machinery, such as Steam Engines, and Mill Works, Shafting and Pulleys, of all sizes, Torpedo Cases, for exploding in oil wells, and machinery for oil wells, of every description.&nbsp; The capital invested is $300,000.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough has been said to show that Dick Foundry and Machine Works is a concern of more than ordinary importance, both as regards its connection with the prosperity of Meadville, and its excellence as an institution which supplies a special line of manufactures with better machinery than can be procured elsewhere.
<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
<center><a name="92"></a>SAYER & CO., PLANING MILL.</center>

<center><a name="99"></a>A. McMICHAEL&#146;S CARRIAGE FACTORY.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This prominent and well established firm ranks among the best and most substantial Carriage Manufacturers in North Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The foundation of the present extensive works was first laid in Woodcock borough, but the demand being greater than the facilities, in 1866 Mr. <font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>31</b>&gt;</font> McMichael moved to Meadville, where, with due energy, care and perseverance, his work has claimed its present standing.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The amount of capital invested in the works is about $15,000.&nbsp; An average of 15 men are employed making an aggregate pay roll of $8,000 per annum.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 150 buggies, 50 sleighs and 75 wagons are turned out yearly.&nbsp; In short there is not a more reliable manufacturing establishment in Meadville.

<br>MEADVILLE DRAMATIC ASSOCIATION.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Organized December 1870.&nbsp; This Society, although young, commands the respect and attention of all interested in the promotion and advancement of Literary talent in our midst.&nbsp; We were unable at the time of publication to give the names of its officers, but feel safe in saying Meadville should be proud of her Dramatic Association.
