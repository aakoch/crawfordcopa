<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oil Creek borough is situated on the banks of Oil Creek, three and one-half miles from Titusville, and twenty-five miles from Titusville, and twenty-five miles from Corry.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Oil Creek & Allegheny River, and Union & Titusville Railways, pass through the town.&nbsp; It contains one church, two hotels, one union school, sash and blind factory, circular saw-mill, and lumber mill.&nbsp; Its inhabitants number about five hundred.&nbsp; The first settlement was made at this point in 1796, by <a name="S1"></a>James Kerr, <a name="S2"></a>James Curry, and <a name=S3"></a>Peter and <a name="S4"></a>Daniel Titus; <a name="S5"></a>Jonathan Titus and <a name="S6"></a>Samuel Kerr having settled what is now Titusville city a short time previously, each settler claiming, by right of settlement, four hundred acres of land.&nbsp; The most of the land included in the borough was formerly held by the Titusvillians, either by settlement or purchase, until part of it was transferred, some time after, to <a name="S7"></a>Charles Ridgway.&nbsp; The first sawmill was built by him.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A large and extensive business is here carried on in lumber.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The place has the best of water facilities.
