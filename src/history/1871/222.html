</center><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This enterprising town is situatead in the midst of a rich agricultural section of the county, on the line of the Franklin branch of the Atlantic & Great Western Railway, eleven miles south of Meadville.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It contains three churches, viz: Methodist, Old School Presbyterian, and United Presbyterian.&nbsp; Its mercantile house, in all the different branches of business, supply a large country trade.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cochranton was settled as early as 1805.&nbsp; The first house was built by <a name="S1"></a>John Adams.&nbsp; Large tracts of land were afterwards purchased by <a name="S2"></a> Joseph and <a name="S3"></a>James Cochran, who were in reality the pioneers of this section, and after whom Cochranton received its name.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A large business is here done in ties furnished from the immediate neighborhood for the use of the Atlantic & Great Western Railway.&nbsp; An extensive business is also done in wool and butter.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The principal manufactories are a steam tannery and grist mill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cochranton now numbers about five hundred inhabitants, and is the principal station on the Franklin branch of the Atlantic & Great Western Railway.&nbsp; It is pleasantly located, and is a very desirable place of residence.
