<sup><a name="N1">1</sup> </a>1844 Pa. Laws 14, 18 (Act. No. 7 ï¿½ 33).&nbsp;  A report was prepared in response to a petition offered at the February 1856 Session of the Court of Quarter Sessions &quot;to establish the line between said Townships beginning at the Mercer County line at or near Crocked Creek on the line of tracks North to the North side of the Township.&quot;&nbsp; A court order adopting this report, issued 18 November 1856, was set aside 14 August 1857.
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;A later report &quot;located a center line for the division of said townships into equal territory, as follows, namely commencing on the south line of Sadsbury Township and the north-east corner of Esq. Terrill's land & the N.W. corner of Jac. Mushrush's land, thence southward about six miles on original line of Tracts to the north line of Mercer county.&quot;&nbsp; This report was accepted 13 February 1858 but evidently never finalized.&nbps; Crawford County Court of Quarter Sessions #59 November Session 1857 (road papers).
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;An 1848 county map shows Crooked Creek as the dividing line between the townships, as it is today. &nbsp; <font size="-2"><a href="#B1">RETURN</a></font>
