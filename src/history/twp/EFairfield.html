<sup><a name="N1">1</sup> </a>Crawford Co. Court of Quarter Sessions Dk. 10:311 (#101 Sept. Session 1867), with &quot;Petition of citizens of Fairfield township for Division of Township&quot;:
<blockquote>To the Hon Judges of the Court of the Quarter Sessions of Crawford County
<br>
<br>The petition of the undersigned, inhabitants of the township of Fairfield in said County, Represent, That the said township of Fairfield by reason of its size, as well as being divided almost through the center by French Creek, which is oftentimes, especially in Spring and Fall, so swollen by high water as to prevent the eastern portion of said Township from attending the elections, (the Election House being west of said Creek), thus depriving them of a choice in their officers, is inconvenient to the inhabitants thereof, and that the convenience and advantage of said inhabitants would be greatly promoted by dividing said township by a line commencing in the middle of French Creek, where the line between the townships of Mead and Fairfield crosses said Creek, thence down the several courses of the same to the line between the township of Wayne and the said township of Mead.
<br>
<br>The petitioners therefore pray the Court to divide the said township by the aforesaid line, and in accordance with the Act of Assembly in such cases made and provided. [signed] Alexander Shaw, D N McClintock, Samuel Doutt, J J Marbarly[?], George Tarrington[?], Iyers[?] Marley, Harrison Dean, Isaac Powell, Robert Cochran, Jacob Gantz, Henry Marly, David McFate, George Evens, Peter Peterman, Thomas Powell, Almeron Weller, John Shaw, George Weis, Wm.
