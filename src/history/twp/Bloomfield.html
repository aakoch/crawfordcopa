<sup><a name="N1" href="#B1">1</sup> </a>After its boundaries were &quot;set off&quot; 29 November 1809, and again after the township was named, some residents petitioned (unsuccessfully) for it to be called <a href="Washington.html">Washington Twp.</a> [q.v.].

<br><sup><a name="N2" href="#B2">2</sup> </a>Crawford Co. Court of Quarter Sessions June Session 1809 (road papers).&nbsp;The boundaries as set by the original report, dated 18 Sept. 1809, were as follows:&nbsp; "Begining at the north east corner of Crawford County thence west along the line of said County untill it meets the line of Rockdale Township thence south along said line to the south side of the 8th Donation District thence East along the south side of said District to the line of Warren County thence north along the said line to the place of begining."&nbsp; Apparently the inhabitants considered the boundaries to be those first given in a petition presented to the Court of Quarter Sessions at its April 1801 session:&nbsp; *&quot;Beginning at the north east corner of Crawford County thence west twelve miles along said line dividing the Countys of Crawford & Erie thence south six miles thence east twelve miles to the line dividing the Countys of Crawford and Warran [i.e., Warren] thence north along said line to the place of beginning.&quot;

Court of Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; The court papers have been lost, and the information presented here is from a condensed report of the commission appointed to determine the new boundaries, printed in the <i>Crawford Messenger</i> of 26 Feb. 1829.
