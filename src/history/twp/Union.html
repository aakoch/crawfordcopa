<br><sup><a name="N2">2</sup> </a>Crawford Co. Court of Quarter Sessions, April Session 1868, on the following petition:
<blockquote>The petition of the undersigned inhabitants of the townships of Union and Vernon in said County respectfully represents:
<br>
<br>That the line between the townships of Union and Vernon in said County as now established is so located that it leaves a short piece of the marsh road in Vernon Township entirely separated, and quite distant from any other road in said township of Vernon and accessible to the inhabitants of the township only by a circuitous rout[e] through Union Township, thereby making it very inconvenient and burdensome for the Inhabitants of Vernon Township to keep said road in repair; That the convenience of the inhabitants of said townships would be greatly promoted by altering the line between said townships as follows, viz: 'beginning at the northeast corner of lands of Henry Landerman, thence west to northwest corner of lands of Michael Yochum, thence south to west side of marsh road, thence along west side of said road to the middle of the channel of Conneaut Marsh, then along the middle of said channel to the present line between Union and Vernon townships.
<br>
<br>The petitoners therefore pray the Court to allow the lines of said township of Union and Vernon as aforesaid so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereof.
<br>
<br>And so they will ever pray.&nbsp; [signed] Henry Laudermann, Michael Joch�m [in German script], J[?]. S. Davis, J. V. Davis, Henry Houck, H. B.
