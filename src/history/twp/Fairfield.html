<tr valign="top"><td>around 1843</td><td>Approximately 411 acres along French Creek at the northwest corner of East Fairfield Twp. (shown on the 1876 Atlas as T. Smith 100 acres, I. Smith Hrs. 204 acres, and W Cooley 107 acres) lost to <a href="Mead.html">Mead Township</a>.&nbsp; This 411 acres and 64 perches, then part of <a href="Wayne.html">Wayne Twp.</a>, was purchased by Rufus Smith by deed dated and recorded 22 February 1828 (DB M[-1]:18).&nbsp; Rufus Smith sold the lower 311 acres, more or less, being part of Fairfield Twp., to Increase Smith by deed dated 30 October 1839 and recorded 7 September 1839 (DB L-2:401).&nbsp; Increase Smith was taxed in Fairfield Twp. until 1844, when his real estate began to be taxed in Mead Twp.&nbsp; He also appears in the 1840 U.S. Census in Fairfield Twp.(household &#39;98), and in the 1850 U.S. Census in Mead Twp. (p. 16/217, family &amp; hh &#39;98).&nbsp; The Nelson Independent School District created 29 April 1856 included the Smith tract with the &#147;Fairfield Line&#148; shown as its southern boundary (QS &#35;41 Nov. Session 1855).&nbsp; The change was not effected by an act of the state legislature, and nothing was found in the Court of Quarter Sessions papers [the dockets from prior to 1855, however, are apparently missing].<td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>by 1850</td><td>About 163 acres from the northern and western part of Holland Land Company Tract 232 started being described as part of <a href="Mead.html">Mead Twp.</a> (although still shown as Fairfield Twp. on the 1865 county map).&nbsp; John Brooks and Henry Laughry purchased this 163 acres, 120 perches of Tract 232 from the Holland Land Company by deed dated and recorded on 27 April 1816 (DB G[-1]:40); Laughry assigned his interest to Brooks on 30 October 1818, recorded 1 December 1818 (DB G[-1]:69).&nbsp; The Executors of John Brooks&#146;s estate sold 129 acres of this land as part of Mead Twp. to Henry B. Brooks by deed dated 18 October 1850 and recorded 8 September 1851 (DB E-2:43); this deed makes reference to the &#147;Mumford Survey of saddle bag tract part above described May 7th 1850,&#148; which has not been located.&nbsp; Subsequent conveyances continue to refer to this land as being in Mead Twp. (e.g., DB N-2:192, dated and recorded 31 July 1856), and it is shown on the 1876 Atlas as being part of Mead Twp.&nbsp; No formal proceedings have been located.&nbsp; On the other other hand, this parcel could have been included in Mead Twp. in the 1829 division, which (as reported in the <i>Crawford Messenger</i>) was described simply as along &#147;the line of several tracts.&#148;&nbsp; The eastern portion of Tract 232, consisting of 155 acre and 4 perches, was conveyed by the Holland Land Company to the Heirs of John W. McClelland, by deed dated and recorded 27 January 1808 (DB C[-1]:258), and remained part of Fairfield Twp. (see, e.g., DB Y[-1]:356, dated 21 October 1843 and recorded 24 December 1845), and remained so on the 1876 Atlas.
