<blockquote><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>115</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>WAYNE</i></b> was formed in 1811.&nbsp; It lies near the center of the south border of the county, and contains 20,066 square acres.&nbsp; The general shape of the township is that of a right-angled triangle, the hypothenuse or south-east line, bordering on Venango county, consisting of a series of right-angles, producing a somewhat singular conformation.&nbsp; The streams are French Creek, which crosses the extreme south-west corner of the township, and Sugar Creek and Deckers Run, which run parallel with the former stream through the township�in a south-easterly direction�and empty into it in Venango county.&nbsp; Sugar Lake in the north part, on the creek of the same name, is a small sheet of water, about a mile in circumference.&nbsp; The Franklin branch of the Atlantic &amp; Great Western R. R., extends along the left bank of French Creek, across the south-west corner of the township.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,464, all of whom were white, 1,359, native and 105, foreign.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending, June 3, 1872, it contained eleven schools and employed twenty-one
teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 469; the average number attending school, 365; and the
amount expended for school purposes, $2,174.54.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Deckards"></a>D<font size="-1">ECKARDVILLE</font>, (p. o.) situated in the south part, on Deckers Run, four miles east of Cochranton, contains three churches, a school, two groceries, a shoe shop, blacksmith shop and fifty to seventy-five inhabitants.&nbsp; It is pleasantly located and is growing rapidly.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; W<font size="-1">AYNE</font> C<font size="-1">ENTER</font> post office, which was established about 1862, was discontinued in 1872.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We cannot state definitely in what year nor by whom the settlement was commenced, though it was doubtless at a much earlier date than we are able to record.&nbsp; We can do no <font size="-1">&lt;page <b>116</b>&gt;</font> better than give the names of a few of the early settlers.&nbsp; <a name="1"></a>James D. Allen and <a name="2"></a>� Wheeling, father of Mr. <a name="3"></a>Jacob Wheeling, settled in the township in 1819.&nbsp; Allen is a native of Ireland, and is now sixty years old.&nbsp; He located where he now resides, when the locality was a wilderness infested by wild beasts.&nbsp; His nearest neighbors, the <a name="4"></a>Brawleys, were two miles distant.&nbsp; <a name="5"></a>Francis McDaniels, who was born in Ireland in 1788, immigrated to this country in 1818, and to this township in 1822, having previously resided in Lancaster county.&nbsp; He settled in the woods and had to make a clearing to erect his dwelling.&nbsp; <a name="6"></a>Wm. Record, who was born in Allegheny county, in 1808, moved to his present place of residence in 1824, and was one of the first to settle in that locality.&nbsp; <a name="7"></a>Jacob Rees came in from Philadelphia in 1829, and located on the site of Deckardville, when there was no house there and the locality was covered with a dense forest, and was the haunt of wild beasts.&nbsp; He was obliged to cut a road to the place of his settlement. Some idea of the animals and game which abounded here may be formed from the fact stated by Mr. <a name="8"></a>John Ferry that his uncle, <a name="9"></a>James Ferry, killed near Sugar Lake eighteen bears and eight hundred deer of which he kept a record.&nbsp; Many encounters with these denizens of the forest, involving great personal danger to those who engaged in them, are related, but the scope of this work does not admit of their repetition here.
