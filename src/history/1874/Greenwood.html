<br><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>55</b>&gt;</font></center>
<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>GREENWOOD</i></b> was formed in 1830.&nbsp; It lies upon the south border of the county, west of the center, and contains 19387 square acres.&nbsp; The major portion of its northern boundary is formed by Conneaut Outlet.&nbsp; The surface is generally level, being a little broken in the north-east part.&nbsp; Conneaut Marsh, which extends along the north border, is about half a mile wide and from 100 to 200 feet below the general level <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>56</b>&gt;</font> of the land.&nbsp; It is well watered by springs of pure water which give rise to numerous small streams flowing north into Conneaut Outlet, and to Little Sandy Creek and Sandy Run, which flow south-east, all eventually mingling their waters with those of the Allegheny.&nbsp; The soil is a fertile, gravelly loam, well adapted to dairying and fruit culture.&nbsp; The timber consists of beech, maple, pine and hemlock.&nbsp; Its numerous springs of wholesome water constitute it a healthy township.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlantic &amp; Great Western R. R. extends through the north part.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,782, of whom 1,761 were native, 21, foreign, 1,771, white and 11, colored.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, it contained thirteen schools and employed twenty-two teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 603; the average number attending school, 460; and the amount expended for school purposes, $2,785.61.
