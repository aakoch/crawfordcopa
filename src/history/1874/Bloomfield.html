<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlement of which we have knowledge, was 
made by a man named <a name="11"></a>Cunningham, who is believed to 
have located in 1795, on land subsequently purchased by <a name="12"></a>James 
and <a name="13"></a>Elkanah Blakeslee.&nbsp; In 1798, <a name="14"></a>James Hamilton came into 
the township, as the agent of <a name="15"></a>John Fields, of Philadelphia, and 
with his advent commenced the first substantial improvement.&nbsp; 
He built the first grist mill in 1800, near Oil Creek Lake.&nbsp; It 
was rebuilt in 1821.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton removed to Meadville in 
in 1808.&nbsp; Between 1798 and 1800 settlements were made by the 
<a name="16"></a>Bloomfields, <a name="17"></a>&#151; Negus, <a name="18"></a>&#151; Piper, <a name="19"></a>James Bryan and <a name="20"></a>Joseph Kirk.&nbsp; <a name="21"></a>Richard Shreve, a son of <a name="22"></a>Gen. Wm. Shreve of Bordentown, N. J., who served seven years under Washington, was 

<font size="-1"><b>*41</b></font>

born Sept. 22, 1760, and came to Bloomfield in 1798, from Red 
Stone, where for eight years previous he was in charge of the 
Washington Mills, built by <a name="23"></a>George Washington.&nbsp; He had thirteen children, nine sons and four daughters, of whom <a name="24"></a>Charles and <a name="25"></a>Margaret are the only survivors.&nbsp; Charles is now living on road 16, and has raised a large family.&nbsp; <a name="26"></a>Wm. and <a name="27"></a>Barzillai Shreve brought a carding machine, which they run two seasons.&nbsp; 
It was the third brought into Allegheny county, of which 
Crawford county was then a part, the other two being owned 
by <a name="28"></a>Lot Lewis, of Meadville, and <a name="29"></a>E. Hewes, of Erie.&nbsp; <a name="30"></a>James 
Blakeslee came to this township from Genesee county, N. Y., 
in May, 1819, followed in June of the same year by his son <a name="31"></a>Elkanah, who was born August 23, 1796, in Washington county, N. Y., and removed thence with his father to Genesee 
county, in 1799.&nbsp; The Blakeslees located on the <a name="32"></a>Cunningham place, which they purchased of some Swedes, who succeeded Cunningham in the settlement thereon.&nbsp; James died at the age of 87 years.&nbsp; The first house built on the site of 
Riceville was erected by <a name="33"></a>Samuel Rice.&nbsp; It was constructed of 
logs.&nbsp; The first saw mill at that village was built in 1830.&nbsp; <a name="34"></a>Seth 
Lincoln, a native of Massachusetts, came from Fabius, N. Y., 
in December, 1837, and took up a tract of 400 acres on the site 
of Lincolnville, where he cut the first tree and erected the first 
saw and grist mills.&nbsp; The saw mill is still in operation, but the 
grist mill relapsed into disuse about two years ago.&nbsp; While passing 
a chute with a raft, on his way to Pittsburgh, in 1847, Mr. Lincoln received a blow on the head from a scantling, which caused 
his death.&nbsp; <a name="35"></a>Salmon N. Sturdevant, also from Fabius, joined 
Mr. Lincoln the year following that of his settlement.&nbsp; He 
purchased ten acres from a gentleman living in Meadville, and 
subsequently fifty acres from Mr. Lincoln, on which he is still 
living at the age of 74 years, and filling the office of town 
clerk.
