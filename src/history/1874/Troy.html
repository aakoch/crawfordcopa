<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>TROY</i></b> 
was formed in 1830.&nbsp; It lies upon the south border 
of the county, east of the center, and contains 17,581 square 
acres.&nbsp; It is watered in the western and central parts by the 
north and east branches of Sugar Creek, which unite near the 
south-west corner.&nbsp; Oil Creek crosses the north-east corner.&nbsp; 
The Oil Creek & Allegheny Valley, Union &amp; Titusville and 
Pennsylvania Petroleum railroads cross the north-east corner of 
the township in close proximity.&nbsp; Among the manufacturing 
establishments are <a name="1"></a>S. B. Hayes&#146; saw mill, which is located on 
the east branch of Sugar Creek, employs two men and is capable of sawing 4,000 feet of lumber and 10,000 shingles per day; <a name="2"></a> 
A. T. & <a name="3"></a>J. C. Burns&#146; saw and shingle mills, which are located 
on the west branch of Sugar Creek, and are capable of sawing 
1,500 feet of lumber and 5,000 to 8,000 shingles per day; <a name="4"></a>Albert 
F. Newton&#146;s steam saw mill, which is situated on Oil Creek and 
the line of the P. P. R. E., and saws 8,000 feet of lumber per 
day; and the saw and stave mills of <a name="5"></a>Johnson & <a name="6"></a>Boush of Meadville, which are located in the western part of the township, 
give employment to twenty-seven men, and are capable of sawing 10,000 feet of lumber and 10,000 staves and heading per day.&nbsp; The timber is brought from the woods to the mill upon 
a tram-way one and one-half miles in length. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 983, all of whom 
were white, 954, native and 29, foreign. 
<br><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>106</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3,1872, it contained ten schools 
and employed ten teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 277; 
the average number attending school, 214; and the amount 
expended for school purposes, $1,165.87. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="TroyCenter"></a>T<font size="-1">ROY</font> C<font size="-1">ENTER</font>, (p. o.) situated on the east branch of Sugar Creek, near the geographical center of the township, contains a 
school, grocery, cooper shop, wagon shop and ten houses.&nbsp; <a name="7"></a>Peter 
Keyes was the first white man to build here, though when he 
came a negro known as <a name="8"></a>&#147;Black Francis&#148; was living there in a 
log hut. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Newtontown"></a>N<font size="-1">EWTONTOWN</font>, situated in the eastern part, on the line of the P. P. E. R., contains a school, hotel, grocery and saw mill.&nbsp; It 
derives its name from <a name="9"></a>Edmond C. Newton, who located here 
Jan. 6, 1847, and purchased of <a name="10"></a>Samuel Sinclair, who is thought 
to have preceded him by thirty years, his property, consisting 
of 200 acres of land, only four of which were cleared, a log hut 
and a saw mill.&nbsp; Newton came from the town of Gerry, Chautauqua county, N. Y., at the age of thirty-three years, and died at Newtontown, Dec. 5, 1872.&nbsp; <a name="11"></a>Wm. McGinnis and <a name="12"></a>John Reynolds were early settlers in this locality. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced by <a name="13"></a>James Luse, who came from 
Essex county, N. J., about 1795, and located on the place now 
occupied by his grandson, <a name="14"></a>Robert A. Luse.&nbsp; His wagon is said 
to have been the third one which left Pittsburgh for Meadville.&nbsp; 
When he came no one was living within nine miles of him.&nbsp; 
<a name="15"></a>Jacob Rishel came with his father from Cooperstown, N. Y., 
about 1833, with a yoke of oxen, having at that late day to cut 
their own road a distance of nine miles.&nbsp; They settled upon the 
place now occupied by the former, on road 12 (see map.)&nbsp; <a name="16"></a>Peabody Faunce came in March, 1838, and located at <a name="Fauncetown"></a>&#147;Fauncetown,&#148; in the western part, upon a tract of land purchased of <a name="17"></a>John McKenzie, who left the place a few years before and went 
to Cooperstown, and is supposed to have settled it five years before Faunce bought.
