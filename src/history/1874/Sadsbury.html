<br><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>94</b>&gt;</font></center>
<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>SADSBURY</i></b> was formed in 1811.&nbsp; It is an interior township, lying south-west of the center of the county, and contains 11,996 square acres.&nbsp; The surface is broken in the north-east part by Conneaut Lake, which lies mainly in this township.&nbsp; It is a beautiful sheet of water, four miles long by two wide, abounding in fish, and its outlet is the only considerable stream in the township.&nbsp; The old Beaver and Beaver & Erie canals pass through the township and unite a little north of the north line, in Summit.&nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western R. R. enters the township upon the south border, but leaves it again in a very short distance.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 1,068, of whom 1,036 were native, 32, foreign, and all, except one, white.
<br>
<br><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>95</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending, June 3, 1872, it contained seven schools and employed fourteen teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 277; the average number attending school, 214; and the amount expended for school purposes, $1,205.29.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Evansburgh" href="../../places/Evansburgh.html">E<font size="-1">VANSBURG</font></a>, (p. o.) is beautifully situated on Conneaut Lake, seven miles from Meadville.&nbsp; It contains three churches, two hotels, and had, in 1870, 174 inhabitants.&nbsp; It possesses rare attractions to the lovers of piscatorial sports, and one of the finest hotels in the county, on the opposite side of the lake, dispenses excellent accommodations.&nbsp; This is one of the oldest towns in the county.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; S<font size="-1">HERMANVILLE</font> (p. o.) situated in the north-western part, on the Beaver and Erie Canal, was once a thriving town of about 250 inhabitants.&nbsp; It derives its name from the late <a name="1"></a>Anson Sherman, an early settler, who died the present year (1873) at the age of seventy-nine years.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; E<font size="-1">VANSBURG</font> S<font size="-1">TATION</font>, (Stony Point p. o.) is situated near the south line, on the A. & G. W. R. R.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We are not advised of the date of first settlement, nor by whom it was made, but settlements were made as early as 1798 or '9 and perhaps earlier.&nbsp; At that time <a name="2"></a>Samuel and <a name="3"></a>Matthew Williamson came in from the southern part of the State.&nbsp; <a name="4"></a>Dennis Hughes came from New Jersey in 1802, but was preceeded [<i>sic</i>] in his settlement by a <a name="5"></a>Mr. Craven, who occupied a log cabin, built under the direction of <a name="6"></a>Gen. Mead, on the site of Shermansville.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes was a robust man, well fitted to grapple with the trials incident to pioneer life.&nbsp; His son, <a name="7"></a>John Hughes, was then eleven years old and is now in his eightieth year.&nbsp; He served as a volunteer in the war of 1812, and offered his services during the war of the Rebellion, but owing to old age and infirmity he was rejected.&nbsp; At the time of his father's settlement salt was $20 to $22 per barrel.&nbsp; It was brought from the lake in small quantities, there being no roads by which it could be conveyed in wagons.
