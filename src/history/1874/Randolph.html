<blockquote><font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>84</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>RANDOLPH</i></b> was formed in 1824.&nbsp; It is an interior 
township, situated a little south-east of the center of the county, 
and contains 23,697 square acres.&nbsp; The surface is quite hilly, 
and is drained by Woodcock and Sugar creeks, the former flowing in a northerly, and the latter in a southerly direction.&nbsp; The eastern part of the township is comparatively new and but 
thinly settled.&nbsp; The soil produces good crops and is well adapted to grazing.&nbsp; Dairying and stock raising are the chief pursuits of the inhabitants, though lumbering is carried on quite 
extensively. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,732, of whom 
1,566 were native, 166, foreign and all, except one, white. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, it contained thirteen 
schools and employed twenty-one teachers.&nbsp; The number of 
scholars was 442; the average number attending school, 350; 
and the amount expended for school purposes, $3,268.15. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Hickory"></a>H<font size="-1">ICKORY</font> C<font size="-1">ORNERS</font> (p. o.) is situated in the north-west corner and contains a church, store, blacksmith shop and about ten 
dwellings. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Guys"></a>G<font size="-1">UYS</font> M<font size="-1">ILLS</font>, (p. o.) situated on Sugar Creek, a little west of 
the center, contains three churches, one hotel, two stores, a saw 
mill, blacksmith shop, wagon shop and twelve dwellings.&nbsp; It 
derives its name from <a name="1"></a>Jacob Guy, the first settler there, who 
built a mill there at an early day. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Black"></a>B<font size="-1">LACK</font> A<font size="-1">SH</font> (p. o.) is a hamlet situated in the south-east part, about one and three-fourths miles from the east line. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first settlement was made in 1795 by <a name="2"></a>James Brawley, 
who came from Lycoming county and located in the south-western part of the township.&nbsp; He built a log house, the first erected in the township, and having cleared a small piece of 
land he planted it with potatoes, the seed for which he procured at Franklin, carrying them upon his back through the woods, up French and Sugar creeks, guided by an Indian path.&nbsp; 
He then joined a surveying party in Erie county, with which 
he remained till fall, when he returned to dig his potatoes.&nbsp; 
When he reached his cabin it was occupied by Indians, who, 
supposing him to be dead, had dug and eat his potatoes and 
were preparing to leave.&nbsp; They opened their packages and each 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>85</b>&gt;</font>  

generously shared with him their furs and dried meat.&nbsp; With 
the proceeds of these he purchased wheat, which he sowed and 
then returned to Lycoming county.&nbsp; The following spring he 
returned to his new home in company with his mother and her 
family, arriving June 6, 1796.&nbsp; They with great difficulty came 
through the woods with an ox team and wagon, driving before 
them three or four cows, the milk from which was strained and 
being put into a churn was converted into butter by the motion 
of the wagon.&nbsp; The journey occupied six weeks, and when they 
reached their destination they had just twenty-five cents in 
money, with which they purchased a quart of salt.&nbsp; There were 
no mills accessible and the family subsisted for some time on 
frumenty, until Mr. Brawley heard, in the fall, of a mill at the 
mouth of Oil Creek.&nbsp; He put four bushels of wheat upon an ox 
and started for the mill through the trackless forest, with 
naught save his pocket compass for a guide.&nbsp; He was six days 
in performing the journey.&nbsp; At night he removed the load from 
his ox and turned it out to browse, while he built a fire beside 
which he camped, and by which the ox was accustomed to lie 
when he had appeased his hunger.&nbsp; Mr. Brawley built the first 
saw mill and the first framed house and barn in the township.&nbsp; 
In 1800 Mr. Brawley married <a name="3"></a>Mary Glenn, and theirs was probably the first marriage contracted in the township.&nbsp; <a name="4"></a>Wm. R. Brawley, who was born Jan. 29, 1802, was doubtless the first 
white child born in the township; and <a name="5"></a>Mary A. Brawley, who 
died in 1805, is believed to be the first person who died in the 
township.&nbsp; Mr. Brawley was followed in the settlement by 
<a name="6"></a>Amos Daniels, who located in the south-western part, on the 
Oil Creek road, <a name="7"></a>Alex. McFadden, who located in the southern 
part, and both of whom settled soon after him, <a name="8"></a>Archibald Stewart, who came from Lycoming county and settled on the Oil Creek road, <a name="9"></a>Alex. Johnson, who came from near Harrisburgh 
and settled in the western part in 1799, <a name="10"></a>Michael Radle, a native 
of Germany, who came from Philadelphia in 1806 and settled 
in the northern part, and <a name="11"></a>Dennis Kane, a Revolutionary soldier, 
who located in the southern part, on land reserved for the soldiers, and who are believed to have settled in the order named.&nbsp; <a name="12"></a>Jacob Guy settled at Guys Mills in 1815.&nbsp; He came from 
Whitehall, N. Y., in 1813 or &#146;14, and located first at Meadville, 
where he lived about two years, when he removed to Randolph.&nbsp; 
He was a graduate of Yale College and interested himself in 
surveys for himself and neighbors.&nbsp; The first house built there 
was erected for him.&nbsp; It was constructed of poles and covered 
with hemlock brush.&nbsp; The sawmill built by him in 1816 or &#146;17 
was the first framed building erected at Guys Mills.&nbsp; He also 
put up the first framed house there and was the first justice of 

<font size="-1">&lt;<b>86</b>&gt;</font> 

the peace in the township.&nbsp; It is said that the settlers kept him 
busy during the winter examining wolves scalps, on which they 
obtained a bounty.&nbsp; He kept the first store in the township at 
Guys Mills, and the first hotel was kept at the same place, by 
<a name="13"></a>James Foreman.&nbsp; Mr. Guy was prominently identified with the 
interests of the township, and lived on the place in which he 
settled the remainder of his life.&nbsp; <a name="14"></a>George and <a name="15"></a>Jacob Cutshall 
came from Cumberland county in 1814, and settled in the 
northern part on the same farm, where they remained about 
two years, when George removed to a farm one mile north of 
his brother&#146;s.&nbsp; They came through the woods with a six horse 
team, crossing the streams that were too deep to ford by using 
their wagon box as a boat, in which their goods were conveyed 
a few at a time.&nbsp; On the way one of their horses died and a bull 
which they drove was driven in the harness in its stead the 
rest of the way.&nbsp; George had to go to Meadville to work out 
his road tax, as there were no roads in his vicinity.&nbsp; In 1816 
<a name="16"></a>Wm. Waid, from New York State, settled a little north of Guys 
Mills; <a name="17"></a>John Oaks, from Massachusetts, settled in the southern 
part, on the Oil Creek road, where he spent the remainder of 
his days; and <a name="18"></a>Leonard Hall, from Vermont, located at Hickory 
Corners, where he was the first settler.&nbsp; He walked all the way, 
averaging, he says, the almost incredible distance of forty miles 
per day.&nbsp; He was married in 1820, and his wedding tour consisted of a visit to his then far distant Vermont home.&nbsp; The journey was made with an ox sled, for which he was obliged to 
cut a road some distance, while his father-in-law, who accompanied him a part of the way, drove the ox and sled bearing his wife.&nbsp; What a contrast this with the expensive luxuries which 
are frequently indulged on such occasions at the present day!&nbsp;  
<a name="19"></a>Moses Gilbert, from Fort Ann, N. Y., settled near a spring in 
the central part in 1818, and remained there till his death.&nbsp;  
<a name="20"></a>Isaac Childs, also from Washington county, N. Y., settled in 
the north-eastern part of the township in 1821, and there died.&nbsp; 
The first school was taught by <a name="21"></a>Miss Mary H. Guy, in the upper 
story of a barn.&nbsp; The first school house is believed to have 
been built in the south-western part.&nbsp; It was constructed of 
logs and greased paper was substituted in the windows for glass.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1"><i>Mount Hope M. E. Church</i>, in the southern part of the township, on the Oil Creek road, was organized with about fifty members, in 1858, by <a name="22"></a>Rev. 
J. Whitely, the first pastor, and the house of worship, which will seat 
about 300 persons, was erected the same year, at a cost of about $900.&nbsp;
