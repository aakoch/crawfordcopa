<blockquote><font size=-1><b>*41</b></font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>CAMBRIDGE</i></b> was formed from Venango in 1852.&nbsp; It lies about the center of the north border of the county, and contains 11,162 square acres.&nbsp; It is drained by French Creek and its tributaries, the principal of which are Conneautte and 

<font size=-1><b>*42</b></font> 

Little Conneaut Creeks.&nbsp; French Creek enters the township 
near the center of the east border and flows in a westerly direction to its confluence with Conneautte Creek, on the west 
border, when it deflects to the south.&nbsp; These two streams form 
the west boundary of the township, separating it from Venango.&nbsp; 
The soil throughout the township is a rich loam, well adapted 
to dairying, which forms the chief pursuit of the inhabitants. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western R. R. extends through the 
township, following the course of French Creek, and the Pennsylvania Petroleum R. R. crosses the central part, from west to 
east, nearly. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870, was 747, all of whom 
were white, and all, except 47, native born. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending, June 3, 1872, the township contained 
six schools and employed eleven teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 207; the average number attending school, 150; and 
the amount expended for school purposes, $792.01. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Cambridgeboro"></a><a href="../../places/Cambridgeboro.html">C<font size="-1">AMBRIDGE</font></a> (p. v.) is centrally located, on French Creek and 
the A. & G. W. R. R., and is distant fourteen miles north of 
Meadville, the county seat.&nbsp; It is a thriving village, containing 
five churches, three hotels, a bank, (organized in 1872,) eleven 
stores, a saw mill, tannery, shovel-handle factory, two planing 
mills, three carriage and two shoe shops, three liveries, and had 
in 1870, 452 inhabitants.&nbsp; It was incorporated as a borough in 
1867.&nbsp; The tannery is owned by <a name="1"></a>F. W. Winchester and is capable of tanning 1,200 hides per annum.&nbsp; The handle factory is operated by <a name="2"></a>B. M. Sherwood &amp; Son.&nbsp; In it fifteen men are employed and one hundred dozens of handles made per day.&nbsp; These gentlemen have a saw mill, capable of sawing 10,000 feet 
of lumber per day, and a shingle mill, capable of cutting 10,000 
shingles per day.&nbsp; They are also engaged in the manufacture of 
cheese boxes.&nbsp; One mile north of Cambridge is <a name="3"></a>H. N. Rockwell's lath mill, containing one drag and five circular saws, employing six men and capable of cutting 15,000 lath per day. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Cambridge Masonic Lodge</i> was organized with eight charter members, in July, 1870, with <a name="4"></a>Prof. H. D. Persons as first <i>W. M.</i>&nbsp; The lodge has a good hall, well furnished, and is in a prosperous condition.&nbsp; The present (June, 1873,) number of members is over fifty, including many of the best citizens in the community.&nbsp; Regular meetings are held the second and fourth Fridays of each month. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Drake"></a>D<font size="-1">RAKES</font> M<font size="-1">ILLS</font> (p. o.) is situated in the north part of the 
township. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced the latter part of the last century.&nbsp; 
<a name="5"></a>Robert Humes, a native of Ireland, came here in 1797 and is 

<font size=-1><b>*43</b></font> 

said to have settled the first farm in the township, on lot 141, 
on which his son <a name="6"></a>David now resides.&nbsp; He helped to raise the 
first cabin built in Meadville.&nbsp; <a name="7"></a>Archibald Humes and <a name="8"></a>Michael 
Sherred, from Susquehanna county, came about the same time.&nbsp; 
The former built the first grist mill in this part of the county.&nbsp; 
Other early settlers at this or a little later date were <a name="9"></a>John I., <a name="10"></a>Thos. 
and <a name="11"></a>Archibald (Jr.) Humes, <a name="12"></a>John Sherer and <a name="13"></a>Henry Allen, the 
latter a native of England.&nbsp; <a name="14"></a>Henry Baugher, from the vicinity 
of Harrisburg, came in about 1800.&nbsp; <a name="15"></a>Leonard Docter came from 
Susquehanna county in 1801, and located on lot 128.&nbsp; <a name="16"></a>Isaac Kelly, 
<a name="17"></a>Thos. Fullerton, <a name="18"></a>Edward Hicks, <a name="19"></a>James Durham, <a name="20"></a>James Weston, 
<a name="21"></a>John Sinclear and <a name="22"></a>Alex. Anderson settled here in 1811, and <a name="23"></a>John 
Langley, a native of Ireland, in 1812.&nbsp; <a name="24"></a>James Birchard, from 
Berkshire county, Mass., and <a name="25"></a>Amos Ames, from the same State, 
came in 1813; and <a name="26"></a>Charles T. Cummings and <a name="27"></a>Dr. Perkins, who 
also settled here the latter year, purchased a large tract of land 
which was settled by emigrants from Massachusetts, and is at 
present known as &#147;Yankee Hill.&#148;&nbsp; <a name="28"></a>Daniel and <a name="29"></a>Sylvester Root, 
brothers, from Hampshire Co., Mass., settled in the township in 
1819.&nbsp; These early settlers were accustomed to go to Erie for 
salt and other necessaries, which were conveyed on forked poles, 
drawn by a yoke of oxen.&nbsp; This was a rude conveyance&#151;one 
which the descendants of these worthy pioneers could scarcely 
be induced to adopt at the present day&#151;but one which was 
adapted to the times and the condition of the country through 
which they passed. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first religious meetings held in the township, when this 
was a part of Venango, were held on the bank of French Creek, 
near the cemetery.&nbsp; The worshipers assembled under heaven&#146;s 
blue canopy, sheltered by the forest trees.&nbsp; A stump cut down 
the center, one-half left a few feet higher than the other, served 
as a pulpit, while the congregation sat upon logs and such other 
conveniences as the location afforded. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">The <i>Cambridgeboro Baptist Church</i>, (formerly known as the <i>Rockdale</i>, but originally as the <i>Lebanon Baptist Church</i>,) was organized with twelve members, Oct. 31, 1812, by <a name="30"></a>Revs. Wm. West and <a name="31"></a>Thomas Rigdon.&nbsp; The Society has erected three church edifices.&nbsp; We are not advised of the 
year in which the first was built, but the second one was constructed in 
1835, and the present one, which will seat 380 persons, in 1870, at a cost 
of $6,000.&nbsp; The first pastor was <a name="32"></a>Rev. George Miller, the present one is 
<a name="33"></a>Rev. Ross Ward, our informant.&nbsp; The Society numbers ninety-five members, and its property is valued at $6,800. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; From the minutes of the <i>Forty-Ninth Annual Session of the French 
Creek Baptist Association</i> we learn that the members at its organization 
were &#147;<i>Geo. Miller, Alex. Anderson, Isaac Kelly, John Langley, <a name="34"></a>Jas. Anderson, <a name="35"></a>Sally Clark, <a name="36"></a>Barbar Miller, <a name="37"></a>Hannah Kelly, <a name="38"></a>Elizabeth Daniel, <a name="39"></a>Christina Miller and, <a name="40"></a>Lydia Anderson</i>;&#148; and the following relative to the discipline 
of the Church :&#151;

<br><font size=-1><b>*44</b></font>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &#147;In the early history of the church every member was required to attend every meeting; if any one but once failed to do so, he was required to give an excuse; if he failed twice, he was visited by brethren appointed 
by the church, who reported at the next meeting.&nbsp; Brethren appointed on 
any committee were required faithfully to perform their duty; if any one 
committed a misdemeanor which came to the knowledge of the church, 
some judicious brother was appointed to admonish him.&nbsp; A yearly meeting was held which all were expected and were glad to attend, and which was ever attended by members of sister churches, commencing Saturday 
P. M. and continuing over the Sabbath.&nbsp; Their greetings on those occasions 
were hearty.&nbsp; Their evening meetings often extended far into the 
night.&nbsp; When they voted to hold a special or protracted meeting, they 
gave themselves to prayer and fasting, arranged their business so that all 
could attend from the first, and gave word to their friends near and far.&nbsp; 
Neighboring pastors would attend.&nbsp; These meetings were short, but frequently from the first, sinners would ask for the prayers of Christians.&#148;
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>First Presbyterian Church of Cambridge</i>, at Cambridge borough, was 
organized with twenty-three members, April 22, 1852, by <a name="41"></a>Revs. R. Craighead, <a name="42"></a>E. W. Beebe and <a name="43"></a>Elder &#151; Kerr.&nbsp; Their house of worship was erected the same year, at a cost of $1,500.&nbsp; It will seat 350 persons.&nbsp; <a name="44"></a>Rev. G. W. Hampson was the first pastor, and <a name="45"></a>Rev. W. A. McCarrell, our informant, is the present one.&nbsp; There are one hundred members.&nbsp; The Church property is valued at $2,500.
