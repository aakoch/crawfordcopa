<blockquote><font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>21</b>&gt;</font> 
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Crawford"></a><i><b>CRAWFORD COUNTY</i></b> was formed from Allegheny, 
March 12, 1800, and provisionally embraced for judicial purposes, the present counties of Crawford, Erie, Mercer, Venango and Warren, with Meadville as the county seat.&nbsp; Erie was constituted a separate judicial district April 2, 1803; Venango, April 1, 1805; and Warren, March 16, 1819.&nbsp; This county contains thirty-four townships and covers an area of 594,076 square acres.&nbsp; It is situated on the west border of the State, being bounded on the north by Erie county, on the East by 
Warren and Venango counties, on the south by Venango and Mercer counties, and on the west by the State of Ohio.&nbsp; Its length is forty-one miles and its breadth, twenty-four.&nbsp; Its surface is undulating, and but little, if any, that is not tillable.&nbsp; The soil is generally of a good quality, better adapted to grazing than to grain raising.&nbsp; That in the western part is generally superior to that in the east.&nbsp; The soil in most of the valleys is very productive, and that of French Creek was sufficiently manifest at an early day, to attract the attention of <a name="1"></a>Gen. Washington, who alluded to its fertility and extent in the notes kept of a visit made by him to Fort LeBoeuf, (now Waterford, 
Erie Co.,) in 1753.&nbsp; The cereals and other crops are cultivated 
to considerable extent, though dairying and stock raising are the chief sources of wealth and profit to the agriculturist.&nbsp; There are not less than thirty-three cheese factories in the county at 
the present time, (1873) and the number is being rapidly increased.&nbsp; It is well watered and was formerly well timbered, though much of the latter has been cut and sent to market.&nbsp; 
Large quantities of timber still remain to supply the numerous saw mills in the county. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The census for 1870 shows that this county stood <i>first</i> in the 
State in the number of farms, none of which exceeded 500 acres; 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>22</b>&gt;</font> 

that it had the greatest number of farms containing between 
twenty and fifty and fifty and one hundred acres; and that, 
with two exceptions, it had the largest number containing between ten and twenty acres, while it had only six containing less than three acres, and 273 containing between three and ten 
acres.&nbsp; It also stood first in the number of pounds of cheese 
made and hops raised; <i>second</i> in the number of acres of wood 
land, being exceeded only by Somerset; <i>third</i> in the value of 
home manufactures, and in the number of pounds of maple 
sugar made; <i>fourth</i> in the value of forest products, the number 
of working oxen, the number of bushels of spring wheat raised, 
the gallons of milk sold and of maple molasses made; <i>seventh</i> 
in the number of horses, and the number of tons of hay raised; 
<i>eighth</i> in the number of acres of improved land, in the value of 
animals slaughtered or sold for slaughter, in the number of 
milch cows and in the number of pounds of wool produced 
and butter made; <i>ninth</i> in the value of all live stock, 
and the number of sheep fed; <i>tenth</i> in the value of farm 
productions, including betterments and additions to stock, 
and in the number of bushels of buckwheat raised; <i>twelfth</i> 
in the cash value of farming implements and machinery, 
and in the number of bushels of oats raised; <i>thirteenth</i> in the 
number of bushels of potatoes raised; <i>sixteenth</i> in the cash value 
of farms; and <i>seventeenth</i> in the value of orchard products, and 
in the number of pounds of bees wax and honey gathered.&nbsp; It 
exceeded Nevada, the District of Columbia and each of the Territories in the number of acres of improved land; Nevada, Rhode Island, District of Columbia and each of the Territories, 
except Arizona (?) and Washington, in woodland; Florida, 
Nevada, District of Columbia, and all the Territories in the 
cash value of farms; all the latter except Rhode Island in the 
cash value of farming implements and machinery; all the latter, including Rhode Island, with the addition of Alabama, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas in 
the value of orchard products; Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, District of Columbia and all the Territories, except Montana, in the value of home manufactures; Nevada, Rhode Island, District of Columbia, and all the Territories in 
the value of all live stock; all the latter, except Montana, in 
the number of milch cows; Delaware, Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, District of Columbia and all the Territories, except Colorado and New Mexico, in the number of sheep; 
Nevada, Rhode Island, District of Columbia, and all the Territories, except Washington, in the number of swine; California, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hamp-

shire, Rhode Inland, Vermont, District of Columbia, and all 
the Territories, except Washington, in the number of bushels of 
spring wheat raised; Connecticut, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, and Washington Territory, in addition to the latter, in the number of bushels of winter wheat raised; Nevada, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, District of Columbia and all the 
Territories, except New Mexico, in the number of bushels 
of Indian corn raised; Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, 
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, Texas, District of Columbia, and all the 
Territories in the number of bushels of oats raised; in addition 
to the latter, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, and Virginia 
in the number of bushels of buckwheat raised; all the latter, 
except Alabama, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas and Virginia in the pounds of wool shorn; 
Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, District of Columbia and all the Territories 
in the pounds of butter made; in addition to the latter, Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia in the number of 
pounds of cheese made; in addition to the latter, (excepting 
Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey and Rhode Island,) Iowa, 
Minnesota and Missouri in the number of gallons of milk sold; 
all the latter, (in addition to Rhode Island,) with the exception 
of Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee, Virginia and 
West Virginia, in the number of tons of hay raised; all the 
states and territories, except California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, 
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, 
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin, in 
the number of pounds of hops raised. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="waterways"></a>The streams, though numerous, are none of them very large.&nbsp; 
French Creek is the principal one.&nbsp; It flows in a southerly 
direction through the central part of the county and unites 
with the Allegheny at Franklin.&nbsp; It was formerly known as <i>Venango</i> (or <i>In-nan-ga-eh</i>.)&nbsp; It is a beautiful, transparent and rapid stream, being for many miles from its mouth less than a hundred 
feet wide, and at some seasons is navigable to Waterford for 
boats carrying twenty tons, though for a few weeks during the 
summer it cannot usually be navigated by any craft larger than 
a canoe.&nbsp; One of the first appropriations for the north-western 
part of the State, in 1791, was &#163;400 for the improvement of this 
creek.&nbsp; Oil Creek flows through the eastern part of the county, 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>24</b>&gt;</font> 

in a southerly direction, making a wide detour to the west, 
and empties into the Allegheny at Oil City.&nbsp; Its name is derived from the oil springs which exist along its banks, the product of which was gathered at the surface in small quantities 
and sold at an early day under the name of <i>Seneca Oil</i>, which 
was supposed to possess valuable curative properties.&nbsp; Oil Creek 
is thus described in 1789, under the head of &#147;Mineral Water,&#148; 
by <a name="2"></a>Jedediah Morse, of Charlestown, Mass., in <i>The American 
Universal Geography:</i>&#151;
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;Oil Creek, in Allegheny county, one hundred miles above Pittsburgh, 
issues from a remarkable spring, which boils like the waters of Hell Gate, 
near New York.&nbsp; On the top of the water floats an oil similar to that called 
Barbadoes tar.&nbsp; Several gallons may be gathered in a day.&nbsp; It is found 
very serviceable in rheumatism, in restoring weakness in the stomach, and 
in curing bruises and sore breasts.&nbsp; When drank, the water of the spring 
operates as a gentle cathartic.&nbsp; It is gathered by the country people and 
Indians, boiled and brought to market in bottles, and is deemed a most 
valuable family medicine.&#148;</font>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Shenango and Conneaut Creeks flow through the western part, 
the former in a southerly direction, near the west border, to the 
Allegheny at Beaver, and the latter in a north-westerly direction, to Lake Erie, at Conneaitt, in Ohio.&nbsp; The other principal streams are Conneautte and Cussewago creeks and Conneaut 
Outlet, which are tributary to French Creek on the west, and 
Muddy, Woodcock and Sugar Creeks, which are affluents of the 
same stream on the east.&nbsp; The Indian name for Cussewago 
Creek &#147;signifies &#145;big snake,&#146; probably from the sinuosity of its 
course, though tradition says it was named so from a black 
snake seen on its banks.&#148;&nbsp; The waters of these streams 
are supplemented by those of Conneaut Lake, in the 
townships of Sadsbury and Summit, Oil Creek Lake, in 
Bloomfield, and Sugar Lake, in Wayne, besides several 
smaller bodies of water.&nbsp; The Indian name of Conneaut 
Lake &#147;signifies &#145;snowplace,&#146; and may get its origin from 
the snow which remains on the bosom of the lake after 
having thawed away in the spring from the adjacent lands.&#148;&nbsp;
This lake, like the others named, is a beautiful sheet of water, 
three to four miles in length and about a mile in width, and is 
&#147;the largest entirely inland lake in the province.&#148;&nbsp; It was formerly used as a reservoir for the Beaver & Erie Canal, its waters having been raised about eleven feet above their original height, 
by an embankment constructed across the outlet. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Geologically the county presents but little diversity, or but 
little of special interest to the geologist.&nbsp; It is underlaid by the 
slates and shales common to the Chemung and Portage groups, 
and is apparently destitute of calcareous rock, except in very 
thin veins.&nbsp; Iron ore has been found in various parts of 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>25</b>&gt;</font> 

the county, and coal exists in the southern part, though it is 
doubtful whether in sufficient quantity to give it an economic 
value.&nbsp; Considerable quantities of petroleum have been obtained in the valley of Oil Creek, principally in the vicinity of Titusville.&nbsp; This county lies upon the verge of the oil-producing 
region of the State, a fact from which it derives immense pecuniary advantage, as the products of its more fertile soil find ready and convenient market in the sterile lands where the oil is most abundant. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; About four miles west of Conneaut Lake, at the summit 
of the old Beaver & Erie Canal, and extending about a 
mile and a half along its line, is a formation of quicksand, 
averaging some two feet in thickness.&nbsp; The sand lies fourteen to sixteen feet below the surface of the ground, which is here a black ash and hemlock swamp, formerly very wet, but 
now dry, being drained by the canal.&nbsp; Much difficulty was 
experienced in constructing the canal in this locality, owing to 
the yielding nature of the sand.&nbsp; Piles eighteen to twenty-four 
feet long were driven along each side, forming perfect walls, 
with cross timbers for a floor, the whole so compactly and firmly 
united as to resist the lateral pressure of the sand.&nbsp; At the 
upper end of Conneaut Lake is a formation of shell marl, which 
covers an area of about thirty-three acres, and appears to be 
seven feet thick at the upper end and two and one-half feet 
thick at the lower end.&nbsp; This marl is worked into brick form and 
burned, when it makes a pretty good quality of lime, though 
not very white.&nbsp; The shells, which are of the genus <i>planorbis</i>, are 
minute and abundant.&nbsp; In the Pymatuning swamp is a somewhat extensive deposit of soft calcareous tufa and shell marl, similar to that in the Conneaut swamp.&nbsp; This marl possesses a 
value as a fertilizer which is little appreciated at the present 
time, and will serve to enrich the surrounding lands when a just 
estimate is placed upon it.&nbsp; <a name="3"></a>Alfred Huidekoper, in his <i>Incidents 
in the Early History of Crawford County</i>, published in 1847, 
thus refers to the Pymatuning swamp: &#151; 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &#147;<font size="-1">* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;From ten to twelve miles in width, it has every appearance of having once been a lake whose bed had been gradually filled up with 
accumulated vegetable matter.&nbsp; Covered with the cranberry vine, with 
occasional clumps of alders, and islands of larch and other timber, the 
subsoil is so loose that a pole can be thrust into it from ten to twenty feet.&nbsp; 
Ditches that have been cut through it for the purpose of draining, exhibit 
fallen timber below ground, and the dead stumps of trees still standing in 
place, show, by the divergence of their roots, that the surface of the soil is 
now from two to three feet higher than it was when the trees were standing 
and growing.&#148;</font>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="railroads"></a>The principal works of internal improvement are the Erie 
and Pittsburgh, the Atlantic & Great Western, the Oil Creek & 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>26</b>&gt;</font> 

Allegheny Valley, the Union & Titusville and the Pennsylvania Petroleum railroads.&nbsp; 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Erie &amp; Pittsburgh R. R.</i> extends through the western 
part of the county, from north to south, passing through the 
townships of Spring, Conneaut, Pine, North Shenango and 
South Shenango, with its northern terminus at Erie and southern, at Pittsburgh.&nbsp; It was constructed in 1867 and &#146;8; is owned and controlled by the Pennsylvania Central R. R. Co.; and does 
an extensive business in the transportation of oar and coal. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Atlantic &amp; Great Western R. R.</i> extends in a tortuous 
course through the central and western portions of the county, 
passing through the townships of Rockdale, Cambridge, Woodcock, Mead, Union, Greenwood, Sadsbury and East Fallowfield, wnth its eastern terminus at Salamanca, N. Y., and with its 
connections reaches all the principal western points.&nbsp; It was 
built in 1861&#150;2.&nbsp; At Meadville the company have a commodious depot, with offices and hotel attached, and extensive brick shops for manufacturing and repairing engines.&nbsp; It is doing a 
good general freight business, and under the present management is becoming quite popular with the traveling public.&nbsp; The <i>Franklin Branch</i> of this road, which was constructed in 
1862&#150;63, and extends from Meadville to Oil City, is owned and 
controlled by the same Company, and does an extensive business in the transportation of petroleum. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Oil Creek &amp; Allegheny Valley R. R.</i> extends through the 
eastern part of the county, along the valley of Oil Creek, passing through the townships of Sparta, Rome, Steuben, Troy and Oil Creek, in a southerly direction.&nbsp; The principal station within this county is Titusville.&nbsp; The principal business of the road consists in the transportation of oil and passengers. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Union &amp; Titusville R. R.</i> extends in a south-easterly 
direction through the eastern part of the county, passing 
through the townships of Bloomfield, Athens, Rome, Steuben, 
Troy and Oil Creek.&nbsp; Its principal business is the transportation of oil and passengers. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Pennsylvania Petroleum R. R.</i> is now under construction.&nbsp; The line extends in a south-easterly direction through the eastern portion of the county, passing through the townships of Venango, Cambridge, Rockdale, Richmond, Athens, Steuben, Troy and Oil Creek. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The old <i>Beaver & Erie Canal</i>, which was recently abandoned, 
extends through the western part of the county, from south to 
north, passing through the townships of West Fallowfield, 
Sadsbury, Summit, Summerhill and Spring.&nbsp; The feeder 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>27</b>&gt;</font> 

extends down French Creek from Bemustown, above Meadville, 
to a point nearly opposite the mouth of Conneaut Outlet, where 
it crosses the former stream, and following the course of the 
Outlet, which it crosses at the foot of Conneaut Lake, and 
unites with the canal on the line of Sadsbury and Summit. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>County Seat</i> is at Meadville, where it was originally 
located on the erection of the county.&nbsp; Its location there was 
made contingent upon the security for payment to the trustees 
of the county, within four months of the passage of the act, by 
the inhabitants and proprietors of that place and its vicinity, of 
$4,000, either in specie or land, at a reasonable valuation, for 
the use of a seminary of learning within the county, and in 
case of default the trustees were authorized to fix the seat of 
justice at any place within four miles of Meadville.&nbsp; By an act of 
March 5, 1804, the Commissioners were directed to erect a court 
house and county offices upon the public square of that town.&nbsp; 
March 13, 1800, <a name="4"></a>David Mead was commissioned Associate Judge 
of the county, and the following day <a name="5"></a>John Kelao received a 
similar commission, and <a name="6"></a> Thomas Ruston Kennedy was appointed Prothonotary.&nbsp; The first court, of which there is any record, was held July 6th of that year, by Judges Mead and Kelso, Dec. 
20, 1800.&nbsp; David Mead having resigned the position, <a name="7"></a>Wm. Bell 
was commissioned Associate Judge, and officiated in that capacity 
at the third session of the court, which was held at Meadville, 
April 6, 1801 and presided over by <a name="8"></a>Alex. Addison. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="courthouse"></a>The erection of the present court house was commenced 
Sept. 10th, 1867, and it was completed in October, 1869.&nbsp; It is 
located on the east side of the public square in Meadville, and 
is constructed in the <i>renaissance</i> style, of pressed brick, with 
stone trimmings.&nbsp; It has an iron roof and is fire-proof throughout.&nbsp; Its cost, including fencing, flagging and furniture, was $249,000.&nbsp; It contains all the county offices, and is very convenient in its internal arrangement.&nbsp; The Commissioners&#146;, Treasurer&#146;s, Recorder&#146;s, Clerk of the Courts&#146; and Arbitration rooms occupy the first floor; and the court room, Prothonotary&#146;s, Sheriff&#146;s and Jury rooms, the second floor; The Janitor&#146;s rooms are in the attic.&nbsp; The jail is a stone structure, located immediately in rear of the court house, and is fitted up with iron cells.&nbsp; The sheriff&#146;s house is in front of the jail.&nbsp; It has been built 
many years and does not meet the requirements of a modern home. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="countyhome"></a>The <i>Poor House</i> and farm, consisting of 215 acres of good 
land, are located five miles north of Meadville and one mile east 
of Saegertown.&nbsp; The cost of the house and outbuildings was 
was $40,000.&nbsp; The estimated value of the property, including 
personal property, is $55,000.&nbsp; The main building, which 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>28</b>&gt;</font> 

is 45 by 68 feet and three stories high, was erected in 
1868, and the old part, or wing, which is 42 by 90 feet and 
two and a half stories high, in 1854.&nbsp; A kitchen, 22 by 36 
feet, is attached.&nbsp; The whole is warmed by three heaters in 
the basement.&nbsp; An abundance of water is suplied by a spring, 
flowing through a pipe.&nbsp; The building is rather low for 
good drainage.&nbsp; The first floor of the main building is 
occupied by the family of the Superintendent, (<a name="9"></a>E. O. David,) 
the director&#146;s office, a sewing room, store room, kitchen for the 
family and three bed rooms.&nbsp; The second story is twelve feet 
high and contains seven good sized rooms, with a hall in the 
center.&nbsp; The third story contains nine comfortable rooms.&nbsp; All 
the females are kept in the new building, except a few of advanced age, who occupy two rooms on the first floor of the wing.&nbsp; There is a bath room, supplied with hot and cold water, in the 
basement of this building.&nbsp; The second story of the wing contains eleven rooms, which are used as dormitories.&nbsp; All the men are kept in this apartment.&nbsp; A kitchen of good size adjoins 
the dining rooms.&nbsp; A small framed house standing a short 
distance from the main building is used as a laundry, and also 
contains a bath room.&nbsp; In the second story is a carpenter shop, 
in which a pauper, who is a carpenter by trade, makes himself 
very useful.&nbsp; The house will accommodate 150 inmates.&nbsp; These 
unfortunate recipients of public charity sleep on straw beds, but 
have sufficient bed clothes, and the apartments are kept clean 
and comfortable.&nbsp; They receive an abundant supply of wholesome food.&nbsp; A physician visits the house once a week and oftener if required.&nbsp; Besides the superintendent and matron only 
one man and two girls are employed, all the rest of the labor 
on the farm and in the house being performed by the inmates.&nbsp; 
Intemperance is regarded by the superintendent as the chief 
cause of pauperism in the county.&nbsp; Fully one-third of the 
inmates are foreigners.&nbsp; There is no special provision for the 
accommodation of the insane, but all who are required to be 
kept confined are sent to Dixmont Insane Asylum.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Crawford, Venango, Mercer and Clarion counties compose the 
Twentieth Congressional District.&nbsp; Crawford county forms 
the Thirtieth Judicial District, the Twenty-ninth Senatorial 
District and elects two Senators, and has two Representatives. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="newspapers"></a>There are eight papers published in the county, viz:&nbsp; <i>The 
Conneautville Courier</i>, weekly, <i>The Crawford Journal</i>, weekly, 
<i>The Crawford Democrat</i>, weekly, <i>The Cambridge Index</i>, weekly, 
the <i>Titusville Herald</i>, daily and weekly, the <i>Titusville Courier</i>, 
daily and weekly, the <i>Meadville Republican</i>, daily and weekly, 
and <i>The Sunday Press</i>.&nbsp; The first paper published in the county, 
and the first west of the Alleghanies, was the <i>Crawford Weekly</i>

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>29</b>&gt;</font> 

<i>Messenger</i>, which was started at Meadville by <a name="10"></a>Thomas Atkinson 
and <a name="11"></a>W. Brendle, in 1805, the first number being issued on the 
second of January of that year.&nbsp; It was Republican in politics 
and its columns were avowedly open to all.&nbsp; The only restriction imposed required that discussions should be conducted with liberality, candor and decency.&nbsp; &#147;This commendable 
rule,&#148; says <a name="12"></a>Huidekoper, in his <i>Incidents in the Early History of 
Crawford County</i>, published in 1847, &#147;seems to have been 
observed for the first few numbers of the new paper, but shortly 
after, when the contest began to increase in warmth between 
the friends of <a name="13"></a>Mr. Snyder and <a name="14"></a>Governor McKean, we find the 
political essays in the Messenger marked with the same bitter 
personalities which mar and disfigure similar contests at the 
present day,&#148; and the stricture is not less applicable after the 
lapse of over half a century.&nbsp; Justice prompts the admission 
that such, however, was not the character of the editorials. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> C<font size="-1">ONNEAUTVILLE</font> C<font size="-1">OURIER</font> was commenced Nov. 14, 1847, by <a name="15"></a>A. J. Mead and <a name="16"></a>George W. Brown, and has been issued 
weekly continuously since that date.&nbsp; The following November 
Mr. Mead sold his interest to his partner, who continued in 
charge till May, 1854, when he sold to <a name="17"></a>A. J. Mason and <a name="18"></a>D. 
Sinclair Brown.&nbsp; Such was the success which attended the labors 
of these gentlemen that the subscriptions reached nearly 2000 
in number, and obliged them to introduce steam power.&nbsp; Theirs 
was the first steam power press in the State west of the Alleghanies.&nbsp; In May, 1856, Mason purchased Sinclair&#146;s interest, and in August, 1862, sold the establishment to <a name="19"></a>R. C. & <a name="20"></a>J. H. Frey, to accept the command of a volunteer company during the war of the Rebellion.&nbsp; He was fatally wounded at Fredericksburgh, Va.&nbsp; In February, 1864, the Frey Brothers sold to <a name="21"></a>J. E. & <a name="22"></a>W. A. Rupert, by whom the paper was consolidated with the <i>Crawford County Record</i>, under the title of the <i>Record 
and Courier</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Record</i> was started in 1858, by <a name="23"></a>John W. 
Patton, as an advertising sheet for gratuitous distribution, but 
meeting with great favor it developed into a regular weekly 
paper and soon became a formidable rival of the <i>Courier</i>, both 
being Republican in politics.&nbsp; At the breaking out of the 
Rebellion Mr. Patton joined the army as a lieutenant, and was 
subsequently promoted to the rank of major.&nbsp; At his death 
from wounds received at Chancellorsville, Va., in May, 1863, 
<a name="24"></a>Fred. H. Broggins bought the establishment, which he had 
previously leased from Maj. Patton, and in December, 1863, it 
was purchased by J. E. & W. A. Rupert, the present proprietors, 
who in December, 1870, changed the title to <i>The Conneautville 
Courier</i>, on account of the age of that paper.&nbsp; It is strictly a 
local newspaper, and is the home organ of a region composed 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>30</b>&gt;</font> 

of the western part of Crawford county, the south-western 
part of Erie and the north-western part of Mercer, in Pa., and 
the eastern part of Ashtabula county, Ohio, embracing a population of fully 70,000, who are principally engaged in dairy farming.&nbsp; It is Republican in politics and is ably conducted. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first paper published in Conneautville was the <i>Union</i>, 
which was started in October, 1846, by <a name="25"></a>Platt & Son, and discontinued the following May. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> C<font size="-1">RAWFORD</font> J<font size="-1">OURNAL</font>, published at Meadville, is the successor of the <i>Crawford Weekly Messenger</i>, before alluded to, 
which in 1834, passed into the hands of <a name="26"></a>Joseph C. G. Kennedy, 
(late Superintendent of U. S. Census Bureau,) who conducted it 
for a year and a half, when <a name="27"></a>Jos. C. Hays purchased the material, 
and July 27, 1836, changed the name to <i>Crawford Statesman</i>, 
which was Whig in politics.&nbsp; In 1841, Mr. Hays sold to a company, and the paper was successively edited by <a name="28"></a>Samuel Magill, <a name="29"></a>A. P. Whitaker, <a name="30"></a>H. B. Brooks, <a name="31"></a>James Onslow and <a name="32"></a>James Burchfield, Democratic in politics.&nbsp; In 1848, the material was purchased by Mr. Hays, who, on the 13th of January of that year, commenced the publication of <i>The Crawford Journal</i>, as a 
Whig paper.&nbsp; <i>The Meadville Gazette</i>, another Whig paper, started 
by <a name="33"></a>L. L. Lord, in 1845, was purchased by Mr. Hays and consolidated with the <i>Journal</i> in 1850.&nbsp; Mr. Hays conducted the <i>Journal</i> as a Whig, American and Republican organ, until November, 1864, when it was purchased by <a name="34"></a>John D. Nicholas.&nbsp; In December, 1865, the office was entirely destroyed by fire.&nbsp; In the spring of 1866, the <i>Journal</i> was re-issued by <a name="35"></a>Edward Bliss and John D. Nicholas.&nbsp; Since April, 1867, it has been successively under the editoral control of <a name="36"></a>Thomas McKean, <a name="37"></a>McKean & 
Frey, <a name="38"></a>Johnson & McKean, <a name="39"></a>McKean & Andrews, <a name="40"></a>Robert 
Andrews & Co., <a name="41"></a>Hollister & Metcalf, <a name="42"></a>Chalfant & Tyler, 
<a name="43"></a>C. W. Tyler and <a name="44"></a>Thickstun & Hollister.&nbsp; In April, 1873, 
it was purchased by <a name="45"></a>Hempstead & Co., the present proprietors. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> C<font size="-1">RAWFORD</font> D<font size="-1">EMOCRAT</font> was started at Meadville, in 1833, by <a name="46"></a>James E. McFarland, who sold it, in 1859, to <a name="47"></a>Wm. Wilson, by whom it was sold, in 1861, to <a name="48"></a>Thomas W. Grayson, the present editor and proprietor.&nbsp; The paper has always been Democratic. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> C<font size="-1">RAWFORD</font> I<font size="-1">NDEX</font> is the outgrowth of <i>The Index</i>, a monthly advertising pamphlet, which was started at Cambridgeboro, in 1869, by <a name="49"></a>A. W. Howe, who issued a few numbers at remote periods, until declining health and 
financial embarrassments compelled him to relinquish 
the project.&nbsp; At his death in February, 1872, <a name="50"></a>D. P. Robbins, 
M. D., purchased the press and material, and in April, 1872, 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>31</b>&gt;</font> 

issued the first number of the <i>Weekly Index</i>, which, by untiring zeal, he established upon a paying basis.&nbsp; At the beginning of the second volume he admitted <a name="51"></a>B. T. Anderson as a partner, 
enlarged the paper to its present size and changed its name to 
the <i>Cambridge Index</i>, under which title it is now published.&nbsp; In 
June, 1873, Mr. Anderson withdrew from the firm, leaving Mr. 
Robbins the sole proprietor, and by whom it is still published.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Evidences of settlement at a time long anterior to the advent 
of the present race exist in various parts of the county, but too little is known in regard to them to assign them to a definite era.&nbsp; Among the nomadic Indians who occupied the 
country when the present settlements were commenced a tradition was extant that these traces of civilized occupancy were the works of a larger and more powerful race of people than they, 
and their character precludes the idea that they were wrought 
by the uncultured red men.&nbsp; In <a name="52"></a>Gordon&#146;s <i>Gazetteer of Pennsylvania</i>, is &#147;the following notice of a curious mound in the county,&#148; &#147;taken from the N. Y. Jour. of Commerce, 1830.&#148;
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;On an extensive plain near Oil Creek, there is a vast mound of stones 
containing many hundred thousand cart loads.&nbsp; This pyramid has stood 
through so many ages that it is now covered with soil, and from its top 
rises a noble pine tree, the roots of which running down the sides, fasten 
themselves in the earth below.&nbsp; The stones are many of them so large that 
two men can scarce move them, and are unlike any in the neighborhood; 
nor are there quarries near, from which so large a quantity could be 
taken.&nbsp; The stones were, perhaps, collected from the surface, and the 
mound one of the many that have been raised by the ancient race which 
preceded the <i>Indians</i>, whom the Europeans have known.&nbsp; These monuments are numerous further north and east, and in the south and west are far greater, more artificial and imposing.&#148;</font>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We extract from <a name="53"></a>Huidekoper&#146;s <i>Incidents in the Early History 
of Crawford County</i> the following relative to the Indian occupancy of the country embraced in this county : 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &#147;<font size="-1">There were originally two circular forts about a mile below the present village of Meadville.&nbsp; The one in the valley, on the farm of <a name="54"></a>Mr. Taylor 
Randolph, and the other a quarter of a mile below, on the bluff point of a 
high knoll, where a small stream puts into the canal.&nbsp; The plough and 
annual tillage of the soil, have now destroyed them.&nbsp; There was also a 
mound to be seen a short distance above the fort, which stood in the 
plain.&nbsp; It is now nothing but a smooth eminence, some two or three feet 
high, and extending from north to south some fifteen or twenty feet, and 
about twice as much from east to west.&nbsp; It is described, however, by <a name="55"></a>Mr. 
Isaac Randolph, one of the oldest settlers, on whose farm it stands, as 
having been composed originally of two mounds connected by a narrow 
neck between them.&nbsp; The material of one of the mounds he represents 
as having been of gravel, and the other of alluvial earth.&nbsp; The ground 
around the mound is alluvial, without stone, and it is evident the material 
was carried some distance to construct the mound, as there was no ditch or 
excavation near it, from which it could have been taken.&nbsp; The mound 
stands some thirty rods from the stream, where gravel is abundant.</font> 

<br><font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>32</b>&gt;</font> 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;The fields in the neighborhood abound with small pieces of Indian 
crockery, resembling common earthenware, except that it is not glazed nor 
so well burned.</font> 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;In ploughing in the neighborhood of the above mound some years ago 
an Indian grave was discovered, covered with a large stone, under which, 
among the bones, were found some interesting relics.&nbsp; Among the rest, 
some sharp instruments of agate or other hard stone, shaped in the form 
of the segment of a circle, from three to five inches long, and having one 
edge, and the points very sharp; they were probably used either for 
surgical instruments, or for tattooing, &c.&nbsp; Indian arrow-heads of flint, 
and axes of greenstone, are frequently found in the flats along the creek, 
and occasionally the remains of pipes for smoking carved out of stone.&nbsp; 
A small idol, carved in the form of an owl, of soapstone, was found a 
few years since, and is now in the cabinet of Mr. <a name="56"></a>Frederick Huidekoper, 
in Meadville.&nbsp; A small turtle, either a petrifaction, or a relic of Indian 
sculpture, has lately been discovered in excavating for a furnace on the 
Big Sugar Creek; it is now in the possession of <a name="57"></a>Mr. J. Russell, at Russellville, in Venango County.&nbsp; The fossil is a siliceous stone, and was unfortunately and wantonly broken by the laborers who exhumed it; the pieces, however, have been obtained and preserved by Mr. Russell.&nbsp; The 
head and front part of the body are entire; the head a little distorted, but 
very distinct.&nbsp; From a hasty inspection I had of it in passing Mr. Russell&#146;s, 
a few days since, I should be inclined to believe it a specimen of Indian 
sculpture, and an idol of the Delaware, or some other tribe of Indians, 
who regarded the turtle as sacred.</font>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;The most perfect of the Indian fortifications in the county is a circular fort, still in a tolerable state of preservation, which stands on a point of land projecting into the Pymatuning Swamp in North Shenango township.&nbsp; The area of the fort includes some two acres of ground, now 
covered with large timber.&nbsp; The breastwork is about three feet high, and 
the fosse from two to three feet deep; there are from four to five places 
of egress from the fort, where there are intervals in the ditch.&nbsp; The breastwork has probably originally been fortified with a stockade, and the portals occupied with gates.&nbsp; On the land side, or the side opposite to the swamp, is another breastwork, some twenty or thirty yards from the fort, 
and now less distinct.</font>

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">&#147;In the interior of the fort there are a great number of places where 
there is a slight depression in the surface, as though a hole had been dug 
some two feet in diameter.&nbsp; In excavating in these places the ground has a 
burnt look, and among the earth are small pieces of charcoal, indicating 
that these holes have been receptacles for fire, and were probably made 
use of in cooking.&nbsp; On the top of the breastwork trees are now growing, 
one of which, a white oak, measured more than ten feet in circumference.&nbsp; 
In the neighborhood of the fort are Indian graves and remains, that have 
not yet been explored.&#148;</font>
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; At &#147;Green Mount,&#148; upon the farm of <a name="58"></a>Mr. Rufus Smith, 
ahout two miles south of Meadville, have recently been exhumed human skeletons, which, from their position and other circumstances connected with their burial, have induced in some 
the belief that they are Indian remains.&nbsp; While the evidence 
thus far adduced does not fully establish this as the fact, the 
position is not rendered less tenable by the counter theory, 
which seeks to show, upon the authority of <a name="59"></a>Mr. Alexander 
Shaw, of Shaws Landing, and other early settlers, that the 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>33</b>&gt;</font> 

remains are those of early white settlers, and the locality a 
burial ground which was laid out upon the farm when it was 
the property of <a name="60"></a>James Randolph.&nbsp; There is little doubt that 
the spot was used as a place of burial by the early white settlers; 
and the irrefragable evidence which exists that this was once the 
home of the red man, renders it highly probable that this 
mound, so characteristic of the Indian sepulture, and yet, possibly, only a natural conformation of the ground, was used by them for interring their dead.&nbsp; It is not impossible, therefore, 
nor improbable, that the remains of both white and red men repose there.&nbsp; The remains which have been disinterred are placed in the Natural History Department of the Meadville 
Theological School, and may prove to be interesting aboriginal relics. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In Cussewago township and other localities numerous Indian 
relics have, from time to time, been disclosed by the agency of 
the plow and otherwise.&nbsp; <a name="61"></a>Huidekoper relates that in 1834, while 
engaged in surveying the extreme western part of the county, 
near Sorrel Hill, he discovered trees which had been blazed 
one hundred and twelve years before that time.&nbsp; On blocking 
these trees the mark of the ax or edged instrument was very 
distinct.&nbsp; Very recently <a name="62"></a>Mr. Eli Brown, while engaged in felling a large oak tree, upon his farm in Summit township, discovered near its center a cut which was apparently made with 
an ax or other sharp instrument of similar design.&nbsp; The number of rings marking each year&#146;s growth, from the cut outward, as counted by Mr. Brown, indicates that the incision was made 
more than three centuries ago, as early as 1573, but by whom can only be conjectured. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This section of country seems to have been considered by the 
Indians as neutral ground, and was probably only the temporary home of nomadic tribes.&nbsp; It is not definitely known that any permanent Indian village existed within the limits of the 
county, though suppositions that such is the fact have been and 
are still entertained.&nbsp; Their nearest village on the east, of 
which we have any authentic record, was <a name="63"></a>Cornplanter&#146;s, at <i>Tinneshantago</i>, on the Allegheny River, and the nearest settlements of the western Indians were at Cuyahoga and Sandusky.&nbsp; 
Among the Indians who were living at the mouth of Conneaut 
Creek was a chief, named <a name="64"></a><i>Canadaughta</i>, to whom, and his three 
sons, (<a name="65"></a>Flying Cloud, <a name="66"></a>Big Sun and <a name="67"></a>Standing Stone,) the early 
white settlers were indebted for many acts of kindness and friendly protection. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement by the whites was commenced in 1787, by <a name="68"></a>David 
and <a name="69"></a>John Mead, who, in the summer of that year, impelled by the 
acrimonious disputes engendered by conflicting claims between 

<font size="-1">&lt;page&nbsp;<b>34</b>&gt;</font> 

Connecticut and Pennsylvania, left their homes in Northumberland county to explore the valley of French Creek.&nbsp; &#147;They found the soil rich and productive, and many of the finest portions of the valley covered with herbage and grass, the forest trees having apparently been long previously removed, giving 
the cleared portions, at this time, much the appearance of a natural prairie.&#148;&nbsp; Their favorable report of the country induced <a name="70"></a>Joseph Mead, <a name="71"></a>Thomas Martin, <a name="72"></a>John Watson, <a name="73"></a>James F. Randolph, <a name="74"></a>Thomas Grant, <a name="75"></a>Cornelius VanHorne and <a name="76"></a>Christopher Snyder to accompany them the following spring with a view to 
making it their permanent home.&nbsp; They located upon French 
Creek, in the vicinity of Meadville, some upon the east bank, 
but principally upon the west side, at the mouth of Cussewago Creek.&nbsp; Owing to the frequent outrages perpetrated by the hostile Indians upon the settlements of this frontier, by which 
these pioneers and the few who subsequently united their 
fortunes with them were several times driven from their improvements and compelled to seek protection at Franklin, the nearest fortified place, the settlements were much retarded during the first eight years, nearly every one of which was marked by the brutal ferocity and vindictiveness of the Indians; and 
not until the consummation of the treaty of <a name="77"></a>Gen. Wayne with 
the western Indians, which was made Aug. 3, 1795, and ratified 
Dec. 22, of the same year, and which brought tranquility and 
security to them, did a rapid, healthy and enduring improvement take place.&nbsp; Early in 1794 the settlers organized themselves into a military company, of which Cornelius VanHorne 
was chosen captain, and a block house was built, in the upper 
story of which a cannon was mounted.&nbsp; The blockhouse was a 
rough log building, with the upper story projecting beyond the 
lower one, and was provided with a centry box on the top.&nbsp; It 
was situated east of Water street, in the city of Meadville, and 
remained standing till the summer of 1828, when, in the progress of improvement, it was removed.&nbsp; The settlers worked their farms as best they could, keeping together in small companies, fearing the isolation which was sure to provoke attack from a covert enemy, and ever on the alert to anticipate and 
avert the danger with which they were constantly threatened. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Wishing to avoid repetition we refer the reader to the respective towns, where further details pertaining to the early settlements will be found.
