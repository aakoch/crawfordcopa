<blockquote><font size="-1">&lt;page <b>59</b>&gt;</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>MEAD</i></b> was formed in 1790.&nbsp; It is an interior township, 
lying upon the east bank of French Creek, a little south of 
the center of the county, and contains 25,472 square acres.&nbsp; 
The surface is hilly, but the soil produces good crops, especially in the valley of French Creek, where it is very fertile and supports a wealthy population.&nbsp; French Creek forms the western boundary and is the principal stream, the only other considerable stream being Sugar Creek, which drains the eastern 
and western portions of the township.&nbsp; The farmers are chiefly 
engaged in dairying and stock raising.&nbsp; Manufacturing, in the 
city of Meadville, forms an important branch of industry.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western R. R. and the Franklin branch 
of that road, extend in a continuous line through the township, 
along the valley of French Creek.&nbsp; The main line crosses the 
creek a little south of Meadville.&nbsp; The old Erie Canal feeder 
also extends through the township, along the valley of the 
creek, from Bemustown, its northern terminus.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870, exclusive of the city of Meadville, 
was 2,421, of whom 2,073 were native, 348, foreign, 2,398, white 
and 23, colored.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, the township, exclusive of the city, contained sixteen schools and employed nineteen school teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 503; the 
average number attending school, 332; and the amount expended for school purposes, $2,398.36.&nbsp; The city contained twenty-one schools and employed twenty-four teachers, all of whom 
were females.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 1,214; the average 
number attending school, 800; and the amount expended for 
school purposes, $28,296.92. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Meadville" a href="../../places/Meadville.html">M<font size="-1">EADVILLE</font></a>, the seat of justice of Crawford county, is situated in the rich and picturesque valley of French Creek, about the center of the west border of the township, and on the line 
of the A. & G. W. R. R. and the Canal feeder.&nbsp; The fine hills 
which surround it rise gently from the creek, presenting a 
beautiful and varied landscape and affording many eligible 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>60</b>&gt;</font> 

building sites.&nbsp; A commendable appreciation of these advantages is evinced in the ornate and substantial public buildings and the many elegant and costly private residences which adorn 
its streets and lend an additional charm to the otherwise attractive scenery.&nbsp; A public park inclosing about five acres of ground is centrally located, and adjacent to it are situated the 
county buildings, which have previously been described.&nbsp; 
Meadville is named in honor of <a name="1"></a>David Mead, its founder.&nbsp; It 
was incorporated as a borough March 29, 1823, and received a 
city charter Feb. 15, 1866.&nbsp; It contains four wards, and had, in 
1870, a population of 7,103, of which number 1,661 were in the 
first ward, 1,961, in the second, 1,635, in the third and 1,846, in 
the fourth.&nbsp; It is the seat of <i>Allegheny College</i>, and the <i>Meadville Theological School</i>, and contains a Business College&#151;one of the <a name="2"></a>Bryant & <a name="3"></a>Stratton chain of colleges&#151;four banks&#151;the <i>First National</i>, established in 1863, with a capital of $200,000; 
the <i>Merchants&#146; National</i>, established in 1864, with a capital of 
$100,000; the <i>Meadville Savings Bank</i>, established in 1867; and 
<a name="4"></a><i>J. R. Dick &amp; Co.&#146;s Banking Office</i>, established in 1853&#151;a new 
elegant and commodious opera house, and various manufacturing establishments, prominent among which are the <i>Meadville Agricultural Implement Works</i>, which were established Dec. 29, 
1868, with a capital of $100,000, and give employment to about 
seventy persons; the <i>Dick Foundry and Machine Works</i>, established in 1864, with a capital of $30,000, and giving employment to about thirty persons; the <i>Eagle Foundry and Machine 
Works</i>, the oldest establishment of the kind in the city, which 
employ thirty persons; the <i>Meadville Woolen Factory</i>, which 
gives employment to seventy-five persona in the manufacture of 
cassimeres, flannels, blankets and yarn; <a name="5"></a><i>Sayer & Co&#146;s Planing 
Mill</i>, which was established in 1865, with a capital of $25,000, 
and gives employment to fifteen men; <a name="6"></a><i>Thomas &amp; <a name="7"></a>Harper&#146;s Sash 
and Blind Factory</i>, employing twenty men and a capital of 
$20,000; <a name="8"></a><i>O. C. Whitney&#146;s Cabinet Organ and Melodeon Manufactory</i>, which gives constant employment to a large number of persons; <a name="9"></a><i>A. McMichael&#146;s and <a name="10"></a>J. A. Dunn &amp; Co.&#146;s Carriage Factories</i>, the former of which was established in 1866, and the 
latter in 1857, the aggregate annual product of which is valued 
at $45,000; a <i>Stave Factory</i>, employing fifteen men and a capital 
of $8,000; and the <i>Meadville Tannery</i>, which was established 
in 1860, and the annual product of which is valued at about 
$20,000. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Allegheny"></a><i>Allegheny College</i> was projected at a meeting of the intelligent citizens of Meadville, which was held June 20, 1815.&nbsp; The main 
building was erected in 1816&#151;17, and the school was opened 
July 4, 1816, though it was not incorporated until March 24, 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>61</b>&gt;</font> 

1817.&nbsp; Its establishment is mainly due to the enlightened 
efforts and untiring zeal of <a name="11"></a>Rev. Timothy Alden, D. D., its first 
president, to whom, also, it is largely indebted for the valuable 
library in its possession, the most liberal contributor to which 
was <a name="12"></a>Rev. Dr. Bentley, a Unitarian clergyman, of Salem, Mass.&nbsp; 
When chartered it received a grant from the State of $2,000, 
which was subsequently increased to $7,000.&nbsp; The patronage 
received from the Presbyterians, under whose auspices it was 
started, was inadequate to its support and the institution languished.&nbsp; In 1829, an unsuccessful attempt was made to establish a military school; and in 1833, its care devolved upon the 
Erie and Pittsburgh Conference of the M. E. Church, under 
whom it has become a flourishing institution.&nbsp; In 1851, a large 
three-story brick structure, containing the chapel, library, 
laboratory, &c., was erected east of the main building, at a cost 
of $6,000, and in 1864, through the munificence of Hon. C. V. 
Culver, was built and furnished the commodious boarding hall, 
which stands opposite the building erected in 1851, and is 
capable of accommodating over one hundred students with 
lodgings.&nbsp; The college is situated north of the city, upon elevated ground, which overlooks the valley and surrounding hills.&nbsp; It enjoys the use of a valuable collection of astronomical instruments, complete and most approved chemical and philosophical apparatus, and extensive and well selected conchological, 
lithological, paleontological and entomological cabinets; and a 
commencement has been made in the formation of a museum 
to illustrate the history of the Fine Arts. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="MTS"></a><i>The Meadville Theological School</i> was established by the efforts 
of the Unitarians, in 1844, and has an endowment of real and 
persona] property of about $150,000.&nbsp; Though denominational 
in tendency the act of incorporation declares that &#147;no doctrinal 
test shall ever be made a condition of enjoying the opportunities of instruction in the School, except a belief in the divine origin of Christianity.&#148;&nbsp; Applicants unknown to the officers of 
the institution are required to produce satisfactory testimonials 
of good character before their admission; and those desiring 
advanced standing must have completed the studies previously 
pursued by the class they propose to enter.&nbsp; No charge is made 
for tuition, nor for the use of the library and text books, and 
students who bring satisfactory evidence of their need may 
receive aid from the Beneficiary Fund.&nbsp; The library contains 
about 12,000 volumes, about 1,200 of which are text books.&nbsp; 
Private and public libraries, containing more than 10,000 volumes, are also open for the use of students.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Meadville is the headquarters of the 20th Division of the  
National Guard of Pennsylvania, comprising the <i>Meadville</i> 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>62</b>&gt;</font> 

<i>Zouaves</i>, <i>German Rifles</i>, <i>Conneautville Zouaves</i>, <i>Conneautville 
Greys</i> and a colored company of Titusville.&nbsp; 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="SpencerHospital"></a><i>St. Joseph&#146;s Hospital</i>, situated near the eastern end of Pine street, in a quiet, pleasant and healthy locality, was established 
as an asylum for orphans, in 1865, by mother <a name="13"></a>Agnes, Sister 
Superior of the sisters of charity of this city, who drew largely 
upon her own private means for the construction of the building and the care of its unfortunate inmates.&nbsp; Not only orphans, but many others sick, wounded, or destitute found food and 
shelter in this institution.&nbsp; The rapid growth of the city made 
the need of a building to be devoted to the exclusive uses of a 
hospital more and more felt, and as the means were not available for its erection application was made to the Legislature at its session in 1869&#150;70 for the conversion of this asylum into a 
hospital.&nbsp; A charter was granted under the present title, and 
provides that patients shall be received without regard to sect 
or condition.&nbsp; The institution is in charge of a competent physician and surgeon, and is under the supervision of the Sisters of Charity.&nbsp; It is heated by furnaces and supplied with pure water 
from a spring, and is capable of accommodating about thirty 
patients.&nbsp; It is self-supporting, and while those receiving its 
benefits who possess the means are expected to pay, no applicant is rejected by reason of his or her inability to do so.&nbsp; Thus, while Meadville has made ample and excellent provision 
for the scholastic needs of its youth, this establishment, which 
stands as an enduring monument to the energy, earnest devotion and noble self-sacrifice of those who projected and continue to sustain it, shows that its physical requirements have not been 
overlooked. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Frenchtown"></a>F<font size="-1">RENCHTOWN</font> (p. o.) is located in the eastern part of the township, and derives its name from the fact that its inhabitants are principally French.&nbsp; It contains a church, (Roman Catholic,) a school, store, blacksmith shop and about twenty 
dwellings. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="MCorners"></a>M<font size="-1">EAD</font> C<font size="-1">ORNERS</font> (p. o.) is situated a little east of the center of the township. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced by the first settlers of the county.&nbsp; 
In the summer of 1787, <a name="14"></a>John and <a name="15"></a>David Mead, from Northumberland county, explored the valley of French Creek with a view to making it their future home.&nbsp; The favorable report 
which their impressions enabled them to give induced seven 
others to accompany them the following spring to this locality 
for the purpose of settlement.&nbsp; The party comprised, besides 
the two already named, <a name="16"></a>Joseph Mead, <a name="17"></a>Thomas Martin, <a name="18"></a>John 
Watson, <a name="19"></a>James T. Randolph, <a name="20"></a>Thomas Grant, <a name="21"></a>Cornelius Van 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>63</b>&gt;</font> 

Horne and <a name="22"></a>Christopher Snyder.&nbsp; The latter two were from 
New Jersey, and arrived at Sunbury, whence the party started, 
while preparations for the journey were in progress.&nbsp; This little 
band of pioneers reached French Creek on the 12th of May, and 
spent the first night on the east side of that stream, near &#147;<a name="23"></a>Kennedy&#146;s Bridge.&#148;&nbsp; The next day they crossed the creek, above the 
mouth of Cussewago Creek, and erected a temporary place of 
abode.&nbsp; Ten acres were plowed in a field, which had previously 
been cleared by some unknown party, and planted with corn.&nbsp; 
A freshet in the stream soon after destroyed the crop and the 
piece was replanted in June, and yielded a good crop, which 
was considered common property.&nbsp; The site of Meadville was 
first settled by <a name="24"></a>Thomas Grant, who, for some reason, left it in 
the fall and returned to Northumberland county.&nbsp; <a name="25"></a>John and 
David Mead brought their families here that fall, and the latter, 
who had previously selected a place immediately south of his 
brother&#146;s, on the west side of the creek, about a mile above 
Meadville, crossed the Creek and occupied the place abandoned 
by Grant.&nbsp; Mead erected a double log house, which was the 
first one built upon the site of the city which perpetuates his 
name.&nbsp; The families of the Meads were the first to settle in the 
county.&nbsp; The remainder of the party located on the west side 
of the creek, principally upon the point of land formed by the 
confluence of French and Cussewago creeks.&nbsp; Having fully 
established themselves in their new homes, their number was 
soon increased by other settlers, among whom were <a name="26"></a>Samuel 
Lord, <a name="27"></a>John Wentworth and <a name="28"></a>Frederick Haymaker.&nbsp; In 1789, 
they were joined by <a name="29"></a>Frederick Baum, <a name="30"></a>Robert FitzRandolph 
and <a name="31"></a>Darius Mead, the father of John and David Mead; and 
these were soon followed by many others, so that the colony 
became respectable in numbers, as well as in the character of 
those who composed it.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this year occurred the first birth in the county &#151; that of 
<a name="32"></a>Sarah Mead&#151;in the family of David Mead; and a saw mill was 
commenced by the same individual, and was completed the 
following year.&nbsp; From this mill in the spring of 1790, was sent 
to Pittsburgh, together with a raft of logs, the first raft of 
boards which descended the Allegheny.&nbsp; The lumber was sold 
for twelve shillings per hundred to <a name="33"></a>Major Isaac Craig, who was 
Quartermaster to the troops located at that place.&nbsp; These early 
settlers were obliged to transport their provisions and 
utensils from Pittsburgh, or the more distant Susquehanna country, whence many of them came, through dense 
forests, devoid of roads, and over bridgeless streams.&nbsp; 
For a long time the streams were their only common highways, and along these, as might be expected, the settle- 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>64</b>&gt;</font> 

ments were first projected.&nbsp; But in addition to the hardships and privations incident to pioneer life, they were for several years harassed and subjected to imminent peril by the 
frequent warlike incursions of the bands of hostile Indians 
who infested this country, and who so long retarded its settlement and for some time threatened the utter expulsion of the whites, who were too few in number to cope successfully with 
their wily adversary.&nbsp; Happily, however, a few of the nomadic 
Indians preserved their friendship for the whites, to whom they 
rendered valuable aid by giving timely warning of the approach 
of their enemies.&nbsp; Among these were a chief named <a name="34"></a><i>Canadaughta</i>, and his three sons, <a name="35"></a><i>Flying Cloud</i>, <a name="36"></a><i>Standing Stone</i> and <a name="37"></a></i>Big Sun</i>, who occupied wigwams at the mouth of Conneaut Creek, 
in Ohio; <a name="38"></a><i>Halftown</i>, also a chief, and half-brother of the celebrated chief <a name="39"></a><i>Cornplanter</i>; an old chief named <a name="40"></a><i>Strike Neck</i>, and 
an Indian named <a name="41"></a><i>Wire Ears</i>.&nbsp; During the year 1790 the settlers 
tilled their farms without molestation, but about the first of 
April, 1791, they were apprised by <i>Flying Cloud</i> of a contemplated attack by the western Indians, who were then on their way to the settlement.&nbsp; This was corroborated by <a name="42"></a>Wm. Gregg, 
who reported having seen eleven strange Indians four miles 
north-west of Meadville.&nbsp; Immediate preparations for flight 
were made, and on the second day of April, the women and 
children were sent in canoes down French Creek, under the 
escort of six of Halftown&#146;s warriors on each side of the stream, 
to Franklin, a small military post established in 1787, where 
were about forty effective men.&nbsp; That chief, at the head of his 
remaining warriors, some fifteen in number, then acted in concert with the whites, who remained to guard their property.&nbsp; They lay in wait during the day at <a name="43"></a>Kennedy&#146;s Bridge, on the 
east side of the creek, expecting the enemy would ford the stream 
at that place, but as nothing further was seen of them they retired at night to the house of <a name="44"></a>David Mead, which had been fortified by means of a stockade and rendered capable of defence 
against small arms.&nbsp; The next day the settlers, after consultation, started for the fort at Franklin, to rejoin their families.&nbsp; They arrived at their destination on the fourth, with their 
cattle and moveable effects, accompanied by Halftown and his 
men.&nbsp; After a month#&146;s stay at the garrison three of the party 
(<a name="45"></a>Cornelius VanHorne, Wm. Gregg and <a name="46"></a>Thomas Ray,) returned 
to the farms they were obliged temporarily to abandon for the 
purpose of putting in their spring crops, but the hazardous 
adventure resulted in the death of Gregg, at the hands of the 
Indians, and the capture of both VanHorne and Ray, both of 
whom, however, effected their escape and subsequently became 
useful and honored citizens, the former locating in the township 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>65</b>&gt;</font> 

of Vernon, and the latter on the east side of the creek, above 
Bemustown, where he died.&nbsp; This same year witnessed the capture and death of <a name="47"></a>Darius Mead, by the same agency.&nbsp; He was made a prisoner while engaged in plowing in a field adjacent to 
the fort, by two Indians, and is supposed to have met his death 
while attempting an escape, as his dead body was subsequently 
found lying beside that of one of his captors, near the Shenango Creek, in Mercer county.&nbsp; The year 1791 was one of extreme peril to the settlers on the western border of the State, 
as owing to the defeat of the army under <a name="48"></a>Harmer in the early 
part of the year, and that under <a name="49"></a>St.Clair in November, they 
were left almost entirely to the mercy of their savage enemies.&nbsp; 
Being thus exposed, the settlements in this county were abandoned, and the locality was only visited by scouting parties and surveyors.&nbsp; In the spring of 1793, <a name="50"></a>Gen. Wayne having been 
appointed to command the army, and confidence in a measure 
restored, the settlers returned and were joined by others from 
the Susquehanna country.&nbsp; At their solicitation Gen. Wayne 
detached a company of twenty-four men, under command of 
<a name="51"></a>Ensign Lewis Bond, from his army to protect them while engaged in putting in their crops.&nbsp; This company was stationed at the house of <a name="52"></a>David Mead, before alluded to.&nbsp; During the summer it was recalled to join the main army, and soon after 
its departure the settlers were again notified by the friendly 
<a name="53"></a><i>Flying Cloud</i> that their old foes were about to make another 
descent upon them.&nbsp; Being without any adequate protection 
they had no alternative but to flee to the fort at Franklin, or 
continue to cultivate their lands at the peril of life.&nbsp; Prudence dictated the former course and consequently the improvements were again abandoned.&nbsp; Some, however, of the more 
resolute ones returned in the fall and winter of the same year, 
in defiance of the dangers which beset them.&nbsp; In the spring of 
1794 nearly all the old settlers had returned and many new ones 
had joined them.&nbsp; Many improvements were instituted; municipal law began to be enforced, and a militia company, of which <a name="54"></a>Cornelius VanHorne was elected captain, was organized.&nbsp; 
The settlers resolved to defend themselves and their homes 
against the assaults and barbarities of their savage foes, and the 
more effectually to effect this object a rude but serviceable blockhouse, mounting a cannon in the upper story, and surmounted by a sentry-box, was constructed on a triangular lot, at the corner of Water Street and Steer&#146;s alley.&nbsp; It was built of logs, and the 
upper story projected beyond the lower one.&nbsp; In 1828, having 
served at various times us a school house, carpenter shop, blacksmith shop and tenement house, it was removed to make way for the improvements of the growing village.&nbsp; The lot on 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>66</b>&gt;</font> 

which it stood was donated by Mr. Mead for school purposes.&nbsp; 
It was subsequently transferred by the Legislature to the <i>Meadville Female Seminary</i>, and by the trustees of that institution was sold to <a name="55"></a>Thomas Wilson. 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="sessions"></a>Prior to the enforcement of municipal law it must not be 
presumed that the social intercourse of the settlers was 
characterized by entire harmony; on the contrary disputes hot 
and fierce often occurred, and were sometimes settled with their 
fists, but more frequently by the arbitrament of a disinterested 
party.&nbsp; A somewhat singular instance of this character is 
related in which a dispute between David Mead and <a name="56"></a>John Wentworth, relative to a field of corn which the one agreed to cultivate for the other, was referred to two strangers who were 
passing through the village at the time and were accosted by 
the disputants on Water street.&nbsp; They immediately unslung 
their knapsacks and, having listened to the statements of both 
parties, rendered a decision which gave mutual satisfaction, 
when they resumed their journey.&nbsp; David Mead was the first 
commissioned justice of the peace in the county, an office which 
he held till 1799, when he became one of the Associate Judges 
of the county.&nbsp; One of the first cases on his docket was an action for debt, in which he was plaintiff and <a name="57"></a>Robert Fitz Randolph, defendant.&nbsp; Unfortunately when the Governor gave the 
people a justice he forgot to give the justice a constable.&nbsp; Here 
was a novel dilemma, but Mead did not suffer it to defeat the 
ends of justice.&nbsp; He issued and served the summons himself, 
and when the day of hearing came a trial was had and a judgment rendered the plaintiff for the amount of his claim.&nbsp; He then issued and served an execution, levying upon a horse, the 
property of the defendant, which he advertised for sale.&nbsp; He 
put up the notices, and at the sale, over which he presided, he 
bought the horse, and paid the surplus proceeds over to the 
defendant. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During this year (1794) the settlers worked their farms in 
small companies, ever on the alert to avert the danger which 
constantly threatened them.&nbsp; Great anxiety was felt for the 
safety of the women and children, and when imminent danger 
was apprehended they sought security in the house and cellar 
of David Mead, a precaution which subsequent events proved 
to be a wise one.&nbsp; On the 10th of August of that year, a settler 
named <a name="58"></a>James Dickson, a native of Scotland, who lived to a good 
old age and left a numerous and respectable family, while 
searching for his cows on the eastern bank of French Creek, 
almost within sight of the block house, was fired upon by a 
party of Indians in ambush.&nbsp; One ball passed through his left 
hand, a second one inflicted a wound in the hip and a third, in 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>67</b>&gt;</font> 

the right shoulder.&nbsp; Supposing the attacking party had discharged all their guns, and being desirous to return the com-compliment, as he had his gun with him, he endeavored to discover the concealed foe.&nbsp; When the smoke had sufficiently cleared away he discovered the barrel of another gun leveled at 
him, and concluding that the head of the individual holding it 
was not far distant from the end opposite that directed toward 
him, he raised his gun to fire, but before he could do so the 
weapon pointed at him was discharged, and the ball passed 
through his hat, grazing the top of his head.&nbsp; Disliking to be 
made the target of a concealed foe the bold Scotchman retorted 
with a shout of defiance and called upon &#147;the cowardly dogs to 
come and fight him fair.&#148;&nbsp; Eager to accept the challenge, or 
goaded by the caustic rebuke, two of the Indians sprang from 
tlieir concealment and rushed toward him, tomahawk in hand.&nbsp; 
Each covered his advance by dodging behind trees, evidently 
fearing the Scot&#146;s rifle, which was yet undischarged.&nbsp; Seeing 
that his retreat to the blockhouse was likely to be cut off, Dickson rushed toward the Indian on his right, and as he advanced the latter retreated.&nbsp; He repeated this maneuver several times, all 
the time reserving his fire, and having gained the shelter of the 
woods he endeavored to reach an old log cabin, intending when 
there to revenge the injury he had sustained before trying his 
speed, wounded as he was, in a foot race to the blockhouse.&nbsp; 
Before he reached the cabin, the Indians abandoned the pursuit and were seen no more, though <i>Flying Cloud</i> and three or four others, having heard the firing, immediately started in 
pursuit, in which Dickson was with difficulty dissuaded by his 
wife and friends from joining.&nbsp; &#147;The old man insisted to the 
day of his death, that once, when he was just in the act of firing, a low voice said to him, &#145;Don&#146;t shoot&#146;; whereupon he reserved his load, and thereby preserved his life.&#148; The last depredation committed by the Indians in this county, resulting in loss of life, occurred on the 3d of June, 1795, when <a name="59"></a>James Findley and <a name="60"></a>Barnabas McCormick were surprised and shot dead 
while engaged in splitting rails about six miles south-west of 
Meadville.&nbsp; The treaty made by <a name="61"></a>General Wayne with the western Indians, August 3, 1795, and ratified the 22d of the following December, brought peace to the settlers in North-Western 
Pennsylvania, so far as Indian hostilities were concerned.&nbsp; 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; With the cessation of these depredations was inaugurated a 
period of substantial growth, and improvements of a permanent 
character were commenced.&nbsp; Roads were laid out and more 
comfortable houses built, and settlers who had previously been 
deterred by the unsettled condition of the country, came in 
large numbers.&nbsp; A saw mill, the construction of which had 

<font size="-1">&lt;page <b>68</b>&gt;</font> 

been commenced some time before, was completed in 1789.&nbsp; 

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the settlers, who moved in about this time was <a name="61></a>Wm. 
Williams, who came from Perry county, through the woods, 
with a wagon drawn by a span of horses, in 1796, and located 
near the State road in the northern part of the township.&nbsp; 
Nearly two months were consumed in making the journey, and 
for several days he was followed by a panther.&nbsp; He cleared his 
farm and lived upon it the remainder of his days.&nbsp; <a name="62"></a>James De 
France came from Lycoming county the same year, to the 
south-eastern part of the township, and took up one hundred
