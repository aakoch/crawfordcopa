<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>UNION</i></b> was formed from Vernon, Fairfield and Greenwood in October, 1867.&nbsp; It is an interior township, lying a little south-west of the center, and contains 8,322 square acres.&nbsp; It is bounded on the east by French Creek, and on the south and west by Conneaut Outlet, which is a marshy waste one-half to three-fourths of a mile wide, with but little fall from the north-west corner of this township to its intersection with French Creek.&nbsp; Partial arrangements have been made to dredge it and thus reclaim large tracts of exceedingly fertile land over-flowed by it.&nbsp; The surface of the township is rolling, especially in the southern part, the central portion being the most ele- <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>107</b>&gt;</font> vated. The people are chiefly engaged in agriculture, grain being the staple production.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western R.R. crosses the northern part of the township, and the old Beaver Canal runs in proximity to Conneaut Outlet.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population in 1870 was 622, all of whom were white, 508, native and 114, foreign.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, the township contained seven schools and employed nine teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 292; the average number attending school, 185; and the amount expended for school purposes, $2,146.11
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; D<font size="-1">UTCH</font> H<font size="-1">ILL</font> (p. o.) is situated a little north of the center of the township.
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced near the beginning of the present century.&nbsp; One of the first settlers was <a name="1"></a>James Smith, who came from the valley of the Tuscarora, in Juniata county, in 1805.&nbsp; <a name="2"></a>Leonard Smock, a native of New Jersey, moved in from Westmoreland county near this time, and settled one-half mile north of Conneaut Outlet.&nbsp; His son, <a name="3"></a>Cornelius, who was born in Union, in November, 1806, says that Indians were numerous and wild beasts abundant, especially in the Conneaut marsh.&nbsp; The nearest mill was at <a name="4"></a>Peterson's, in Greenwood, and although the distance was not great the roads were so bad that they would defer a journey thither until the meal box was thoroughly scraped out.&nbsp; It was the custom of the miller at times to keep bread in the mill for his customers to lunch upon.&nbsp; <a name="5"></a>John Thatcher came in from Greenwood, his native township, in 1810.&nbsp; <a name="6"></a>Daniel Holton removed from Rhode Island to Meadville in 1796, and to Union in 1815.&nbsp; His son, <a name="7"></a>Baanah, says he (Daniel) drove the first team into Meadville.&nbsp; <a name="8"></a>Peter Kebert, from Germany, settled here in 1830.&nbsp; <a name="9"></a>Francis Stein, from Bavaria, came in 1832.&nbsp; He came by canal from Albany to Buffalo, by lake to Erie, and thence on foot to his destinationï¿½his present place of residence.&nbsp; <a name="10"></a>Daniel Hammon, from Germany, settled here in 1833, and a <a name="11"></a>Mr. Huber, from New Jersey, in 1834.&nbsp; The first school, a framed building, was built in 1838, on the Aqueduct road; and the first church was erected in 1837, on the State road.&nbsp; It was a log structure and was converted to a framed building in 1854, by <a name="12"></a>Wm. Stitt.
<br>
<br><font size="-1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Mount Pleasant Church</i> (M.E.) was organized with twelve members, in 1826, by <a name="13"></a>John Leech and <a name="14"></a>H. Kinsley, who officiated as first pastors.&nbsp; The Society worshiped at first in school houses.&nbsp; Their house of worship was erected in 1858, at a cost of $1,000.&nbsp; It will seat 300 persons.&nbsp; There are forty-five members, who are under the pastoral care of <a name="15"></a>Rev. F. Fair.&nbsp; The Church property is valued at $1,200.
