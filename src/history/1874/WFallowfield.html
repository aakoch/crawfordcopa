<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>*117</b></font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>WEST FALLOWFIELD</i></b> was formed from East Fallowfield in 1845.&nbsp; It lies upon the south border of the county, west of the center, and contains 6,629 square acres.&nbsp; The surface is undulating and heavily timbered, principally with pine, oak and chestnut.&nbsp; The soil is a clayey loam.&nbsp; The principal 
stream is Crooked Creek, which separates it from East Fallowfield.&nbsp; The old Beaver & Erie Canal extends through the eastern part of the township, in close proximity to Crooked Creek. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 691, all of whom were white, 664, native and 27, foreign. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, the township contained five schools and employed nine teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 204; the average number attending school, 137; and the amount expended for school purposes, $1,173.12. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; H<font size="-1">ARTSTOWN</font> (p. v.) is situated a little north of the center of the township, on the line of the old Beaver & Erie Canal and at the outlet of a large reservoir which fed the Canal, but from which, since the latter&#146;s abandonment, the water has been drawn.&nbsp; It was incorporated as a borough in 1851, and had, in 
1870, a population of 188.&nbsp; The number of inhabitants has not 
materially changed since then.&nbsp; It has three churches, one 
school, a hotel, two stores, one harness shop, three carriage 
shops, two blacksmith shops, a barrel factory, a shoe shop and 
a steam grist mill, just completed, containing two runs of stones.&nbsp; 
The reservoir which supplied the canal at this place covered 
about 600 acres, and being well stocked with fish was a favorite 
resort for the lovers of piscatorial sport.&nbsp; Bass, white fish and 
pickerel were caught here in great abundance.&nbsp; The water was 
drawn off in 1872.&nbsp; Before the canal was abandoned Hartstown 
was a thriving village. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A<font size="-1">DAMSVILLE</font> (p. o.) is situated in the southern part of the township and contains two churches, (and a Society of Old-School Presbyterians who have no edifice,) three stores, two 
blacksmith shops, two shoe shops, one carriage shop, a steam 
flouring mill, (with three runs of stones and a capacity for 
grinding forty bushels of grain per day,) thirty dwellings and 
about 150 inhabitants. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was begun in the latter part of the last century.&nbsp; <a name="1"></a>Hugh Fletcher was the first to settle in the northern part of the township.&nbsp; He was a native of Ireland and came here in 
1797.&nbsp; His daughter, <a name="2"></a>Sarah, was the first white female child 
born in Shenango township.&nbsp; <a name="3"></a>Hugh Blair, also from Ireland, 
came in 1802 and settled upon a tract of one hundred acres 
about one mile north of Hartstown. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size="-1">The <i>Hartstown United Presbyterian Church</i> was organized in 1830, by <a name="4"></a>Dr. 
Dinwiddie.&nbsp; The first pastor was <a name="5"></a>Rev. S. F. Smith.&nbsp; The first church edi-
<font size=-1><b>*118</b></font> 
fice was erected in 1830, and the present one in 1855, at a cost of $2,500.&nbsp; It will seat 500 persons.&nbsp; The present pastor is <a name="6"></a>Rev. H. H. Hervey, our informant, and the number of members, 130.&nbsp; The Church property is valued at $3,000. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>M. E. Church</i>, at Hartstown, was organized with fifteen members in 1840, in which year was erected the church edifice, (which will seat 175 persons) at a cost of $500.&nbsp; The pastor is <a name="7"></a>Rev. H. S. Goodrich, and the number of members, 35.&nbsp; The Church property is valued at $400.&#151;[<i>Information furnished by Mr. <a name="8"></a>Enoch Ellis</i>. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Adamsville Freewill Baptist Church</i> was organized with twenty-one members, in April, 1853, by <a name="9"></a>Revs. J. S. Manning and <a name="10"></a>J. B. Page, the former of whom was the first pastor.&nbsp; Their house of worship, which will seat 250 persons, was erected in 1853, at a cost of $1,200.&nbsp; The Society numbers fifty-five, and is under the spiritual tutelage of <a name="11"></a>Rev. N. H. Farr, our informant.
