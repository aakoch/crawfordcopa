<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>FAIRFIELD</i></b> was formed in 1811.&nbsp; It is situated near the center of the south border of the county and contains 10756 square acres.&nbsp; The surface in the north is rolling and hilly, while in the south it is generally level.&nbsp; It is drained by French Creek and Conneaut Outlet, which form the northern boundary, and small streams flowing into these.&nbsp; The soil is a gravelly loam, well adapted to the uses of the pomologist.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 871, all of whom were white, 822, native and 49, foreign.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, the township contained seven schools and employed twelve teachers.&nbsp; The number of scholars was 323; the average number attending school, 214; and the amount expended for school purposes, $967.30.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced as early as 1791, in which year <a name="1"></a>Joseph Dickson, from Cumberland county, located on the farm <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>55</b>&gt;</font> now owned by <a name="2"></a>E. P. Slocum.&nbsp; He came alone and on foot, and it is related that at night he was accustomed to seek protection from the hostile Indians within the friendly shelter of a hollow tree.&nbsp; He was working at one time on French Creek, in company with <a name="3"></a>Wm. Finley and <a name="4"></a>B. McCormick, and in response to the sound of the horn he started for dinner.&nbsp; His companions did not accompany him and soon after his attention was attracted by two shots.&nbsp; An examination revealed the dead bodies of his two friends, who had been shot and scalped.&nbsp; <a name="5"></a>Archibald Hill came from Ireland, where he had followed the vocation of a weaver, in 1796.&nbsp; The country was a dense wilderness, infested by dear, bears, wild cats, raccoons and wild turkies [sic].&nbsp; He was married May 30, 1800, and died May 3, 1817, in his fifty-third year.&nbsp; The following year (1797) <a name="6"></a>Andrew McFaden, in company with his brother <a name="7"></a>John, came from Susquehanna county and settled on Conneaut Outlet, where he remained a year and a half, when he removed to Sugar Creek, and thence to Sugar Lake, where he remained till his death, in 1823, at the age of seventy-two years.&nbsp; At that time two Indians for every white man could be seen here.&nbsp; <a name="8"></a>Truman Mallory came from Connecticut in 1817.&nbsp; He was a carpenter by trade and brought with him his square.&nbsp; Four families named <a name="9"></a>Weller, <a name="10"></a>Sweney, <a name="11"></a>Dewey and <a name="12"></a>Ellis came the same time.&nbsp; Weller was killed the same year by the fall of a tree which he felled, and Mallory made the coffin in which he was buried.&nbsp; During the night the wolves unearthed the coffin and gnawed through it, but owing to the approach of daylight were deterred from molesting the body.
