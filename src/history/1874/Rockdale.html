<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>*91</b></font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><i>ROCKBALE</i></b> was formed in 1811.&nbsp; It lies upon the 
north border of the county, east of the center, and contains 
21,702 square acres.&nbsp; It is well watered by French Creek, 
(which enters the township near the center of the north line, 
flows south to near the center and deflects to the west, 
leaving it near the center of the west line,) and streams tributary to it, the principal of which are Muddy Creek and Thomas 
and Mohawk runs.&nbsp; The surface is hilly, except in the valleys 
of French and Muddy Creeks, which are low and level.&nbsp; The 
soil in the valleys is a rich alluvium of great fertility; elsewhere 
it is a mixture of clay and sand.&nbsp; Agriculture is the chief persuit of the inhabitants, and dairying the principal branch of 
agriculture.&nbsp; Until within a few years a large portion of the 
township was devoted almost entirely to lumbering, which, at 
present, forms an important industry.&nbsp; There is now more lumber shipped at Millers Station than any other along this route.&nbsp; Lumber is the principal article of manufacture.&nbsp; There are not 
less than five important saw mills which manufacture daily over 
60,000 feet of lumber, besides a large quantity of lath and 
shingles; a grist mill, capable of grinding 45 bushels of grain 
per hour; and a cheese factory, built the present year, (1873) 
capacitated to use the milk of 400 cows. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Atlantic & Great Western R. R. traverses the north-west part of the township, following the course of French Creek, which it crosses within the limits of the township. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The population of the township in 1870 was 1,664, of whom 
1,591 were native, 134, foreign and all, white. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; During the year ending June 3, 1872, it contained twelve 
schools and employed twenty-four teachers.&nbsp; The number of 
scholars was 516; the average number attending school, 396 ; 
and the amount expended for school purposes, $2,110.99. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="Millers"></a>M<font size="-1">ILLERS</font> S<font size="-1">STATION</font> (p. o.) is a hamlet situated on the A. & G. W. R. R., a little north-west of the center, and contains one 
hotel, three stores, one blacksmith shop and one shoe shop. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Settlement was commenced contemporaneously with that of 
the county, in 1786, by <a name="1"></a>John Hayes 2d, a native of Delaware, 
who accompanied <a name="2"></a>Gen. Mead in his journey to the county. 

<font size="-1"><b>*92</b></font>  
He purchased of <a name="3"></a>Wm. Hutchinson a piece of land on which he 
had commenced, but not completed a settlement, paying therefor $1,100.&nbsp; His daughter <a name="4"></a>Sarah, now <a name="5"></a>Mrs. <a name="6"></a>Joseph King, who was born in this township, May 24, 1798, and married to her 
husband (who served as a captain under <a name="7"></a>Gen. Hull in the war 
of 1812,) in September, 1814, is still living with her daughter, 
<a name="8"></a>Mrs. <a name="9"></a>Ezra A. Tubbs.&nbsp; The principal settlements were made 
about 1795, under the auspices of the Holland Land Company, 
who are believed to have built the first house in the township, 
near what is now known as <a name="10"></a>Jarvis&#146; Mill.&nbsp; <a name="11"></a>Isaac Kelly, from 
Delaware county, and <a name="12"></a>George Miller, a Baptist clergyman, from 
Lehigh county, settled here about 1800.&nbsp; Kelly located on the 
east side of French Creek, near the center of the township, at 
the place now known as <a name="13"></a>Wing&#146;s saw mill.&nbsp; Other settlers about 
the same year were <a name="14"></a>Hugh and <a name="15"></a>Patrick McCulloph, and a man 
named <a name="16"></a>Priest.&nbsp; The McCullophs, it is believed, were natives of 
Ireland.&nbsp; <a name="17"></a>Nathan Mitchell, a native of Mass., moved into the 
the township from Canada, where he had resided four years, in 
1802.&nbsp; He settled on the line between Erie and Crawford 
counties, and died in 1834.&nbsp; <a name="18"></a>Jesse Brown, who was born in 
Mass., Feb. 5, 1777, removed with his father to Vermont, where 
they remained till after the war of 1812.&nbsp; In 1815, they removed to the township of LeBoeuf, Erie county, and in 1818, 
to this township, where they purchased a tract of land, on 
which his father died, April 22, 1871.&nbsp; &#147;When we came to this 
place,&#148; says Mr. Brown, &#147;we underwent great inconveniences.&nbsp; 
We had to go fourteen miles through the woods to mill.&nbsp; But 
game was plenty, and we got half our living out of the woods.&nbsp; 
The wolves used to trouble our sheep.&nbsp; The bears and panthers, 
though numerous, did not trouble us much.&#148;&nbsp; The farm of <a name="19"></a>H. 
R. Colwell was donated by the State to <a name="20"></a>Col. Benjamin Flower, 
as a Revolutionary grant, in 1785, but the present owner was 
the first to settle it, in 1838. 
<br>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The only church ever erected in the township was built by a Baptist Society, in 1825.&nbsp; It was situated on the farm now occupied by <a name="21"></a>Daniel Miller, but was long since torn down.&nbsp; 
Elder George Miller, was the officiating clergyman.&nbsp; <a name="22"></a>Isaac 
Miller was an active member of this church.&nbsp; He was drowned 
in French Creek one Sabbath morning in 1832, while crossing 
upon the ice on his way to attend church.
