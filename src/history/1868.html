<center>MEADVILLE.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HIS</font> church is in Crawford County, and was probably organized in 1800.&nbsp; Elisha Macurdy and Joseph Stockton (4) had preached here the year before.&nbsp; The first elders were John Cotton, Robert Stockton, and a third, whose name has passed away.&nbsp; Mr. Stockton, then in his twenty-first year, was called to be the first pastor.&nbsp; He was ordained by the Presbytery of Ohio, on the 24th of June, 1801, and installed as pastor of the congregations of Meadville and Little Sugar Creek<a href="#N1"><font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font></a> (now Cochranton).&nbsp; One half his time was given to each.&nbsp; He was released from these charges June 27, 1810.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The second pastor was Rev. Robert Johnston (15).&nbsp; He was installed, October 15, 1811, as pastor of Meadville, Little Sugar Creek, and Conneaut (now Evanaburg).&nbsp;  This relation was dissolved April 2, 1817.&nbsp; The third pastor was Rev. John Van Liew (30).&nbsp; He was ordained and installed August 22, 1821.&nbsp; He gave the whole of his time to Meadville, and was released from his charge, June 21, 1824.&nbsp; The fourth pastor was Rev. Wells Bushnell (35).&nbsp; He was ordained and installed June 22, 1826.&nbsp; The pastoral relation was dissolved June 26, 1833.&nbsp; The fifth pastor was Nathaniel West (47), installed May 11, 1836; released from his pastoral charge, June 26, 1838.&nbsp; The present pastor is John Van Liew Reynolds, D. D. (56); ordained and installed November 13, 1839.&nbsp; Of those who have sus- <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>414</b>&gt;</font> tained the pastoral relation to this church, besides the present incumbent, one only survives &mdash; Dr. Van LIew.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; From the installation of Dr. Reynolds in 1839, the session remained unbroken for twenty-five years, without increase or diminution.&nbsp; At the division of the church in 1838, the Meadville church was divided, forming a second church, of the other branch.&nbsp; Of this church, Rev. Richard Craighead has long been the pastor.

<center>PYMATUNING, BEULA, AND TRUMBULL.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HESE</font> congregatons constituted the original charge of Rev. Benjamin Boyd, and all seem to have become extinct.&nbsp; They were situated near the boundary line of Ohio and Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Mr. Boyd was installed over them November 12, 1806, and was dismissed in 1809.&nbsp; These churches seem to have declined soon after.&nbsp; The names of Beula and Trunbull do not appear on the roll after the year 1810; and Pymatuning is not mentioned after 1813.&nbsp; The membership was probably drawn to churches springing up in more favorable locations in the neighborhood.

<center>GRAVEL RUN.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HIS</font> church is in Crawford County, and was probably organized in 1809 or 1810.&nbsp; The first pastor was <font size="-1">&lt;p. <b>444</b>&gt;</font> Rev.

Peter Hassinger (39).&nbsp; He was ordained and installed, October 1, 1828; released from his charge in 1832.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Rev. Alexander Cunningham (65) was ordained and installed as pastor, October 5, 1843; released from his charge in 1851.&nbsp; The present pastor is Rev. James W. Dickey (64), installed April 19, 1854.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; At the division in 1838, this church was divided, a portion adhering to each branch.&nbsp; The New School branch is called also Gravel Run; Rev. G. W. Hampson is the pastor.

<center>OIL CREEK, now TITUSVILLE.</center>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HIS</font> church was gathered and organized by Rev. Amos Chase (25) about the year 1815.&nbsp; Mr. Chase supplied it until the 24th day of May, 1826, when he was installed as its first pastor for one half of his time.&nbsp; The pastoral relation was dissolved in 1830.&nbsp; The next pastor was Rev. G. W. Hampson (43), who was ordained and installed as pastor by the Presbytery of Erie, June 27, 1832.&nbsp; He continued his relation for some ten years, when the relation was dissolved.&nbsp; Owing to peculiar circumstances, the church gradually became disorganized, and its individuality lost.&nbsp; A few years ago it was reorganized under the name of the First Presbyterian Church of Titusville, Rev. William Howell Taylor, pastor.&nbsp; It is situated in Crawford County, Pa., and in connection with the other branch.
