<br><b>RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF MEADVILLE</b></center>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IN all departments of human enterprise the outward expression will in time
come to conform to the inward life or appreciation. In that state, or
society, where wealth is not more lavished upon social luxury than upon
those institutions which have for their aim the elevation of the people morally
and intellectually, we may safely look for a commonwealth in which all truly
wise parents will gladly place their children. To a stranger in her midst who
is weighing these serious considerations, Meadville may, without boasting,
say: "Look at my churches and my schools." Shall we essay to honor
the men who year after year have helped, by wise counsel and wiser action,
to uprear these structures devoted to. learning and religion? Lo! their
works praise them. Tower and spire, and firm foundation stone are mute
but eloquent eulogists.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This high moral and intellectual standing as a community has contributed
largely towards the growth and development of the city, and will
undoubtedly in the future, as in the past, attract as residents a most desirable
class of citizens. There is no department of society more worthy of serious
consideration, and hence it deserves a prominent space in historical compositions.
First Presbyterian Church.-The first public religious services in Meadville
were held in the old Gill House, situated on Water Street, and subsequently
in the court-room over the old jail, that stood on the ground now occupied
by the law office of Haskins-Sz McClintock, on the Diamond. Elisha
Mcf'urdy, a member of the Presbytery of Ohio, and Joseph Stockton, a licentiate
of the same Presbytery, were the first ordained ministers who preached
within the bounds of what is now Crawford County. They 'were sent out on a
missionary tour in 1799, and, among other places, preached in Meadville. The
next year Mr. Stockton received an invitation to preach statedly at this place,
<center>page 276</center>
and in the fall of 1800 left his home in Washington County, and, with his
young wife and some household goods, came on horseback to establish himself
in Meadville. Over this church, in connection with that of Little Sugar
Creek, now Cochranton, he was ordained as pastor on June 24, 180!. His
duties as pastor of these charges continued until June 27, 1810, when the
Erie Presbytery dissolved the relation. While still officiating in Meadville
he traveled through and preached at different points in Erie and Mercer
Counties, and was the first principal of the Meadville Academy, opened in
1805. John Cotton, Robert Stockton and Hugh Cotton were the first
elders of the Meadville Church.
Robert Johnston, the second pastor of the church, was installed over
the churches at Meadville, Little Sugar Creek and Conneaut Lake on October
IS, 181I, and divided his time equally between Meadville and the other
two churches. During his pastorate Mr. Johnston organized a Sundayschool,
which was opened in December, 1814. Thomas Atkinson, of the
Messenger, assisted in the undertaking. It had no official board, but was a
spontaneous effort to bring the youth of the village under the influence of
moral teaching. Mr. Johnston served as pastor until April, 1817.
At their meeting in January, r815, the Board of Trustees fixed the
pastor's salary for the Meadville Church at $200 per annum, from which one
can infer that the position was not a bonanza. Soon afterwards it was decided
to build a church, and a building committee was appointed, consisting
of the following well-remembered pioneers: William Clark. William
Foster, Samuel Torbett, Daniel Bemus and John Reynolds. It was to be
a brick building, 60x70 feet in dimensions, finished within two years, and at
a total cost of $6,500. On the 5th of February, 1818, a contract for the
erection of the church was let to George Davis. It occupied the site of the
present church, and the building was completed and the' pews sold on August
14, 1820. This building was the only place for public worship in the
village until 1825, when the Methodists fitted up a room on South Main
Street.
John Van Liewbegan his pastorate in Meadville in August, 1821, and
continued three years, when, owing to impaired health, the relation was dissolved.
He was succeeded by Wells Bushnell, who remained seven years,
when he went as a missionary to the Indians, his congregation reluctantly
consenting to his withdrawal. Nathaniel West, the next pastor, remained
<center>page 278</center>
two years. He was succeeded by John V. Reynolds, D. D., who for thirty
years filled the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church, the Presbytery dissolving
the relation, at his request, in April, 1869. James G. Carnachan,
LL. D., succeeded him, and continued his pastorate twelve years. It was
during his pastorate, in 1874-75, that the present handsome edifice was
erected, at a cost of about $43,000, and it "vas dedicated on August 22, 1875.
It stands on the southwest corner of Liberty ana Center Streets, has a seating
capacity of 750, and is regarded as one of the finest church properties
in Meadville. The pastor's residence is on the opposite corner from the
church, and is a comfortable two-story frame.
In the spring of 1881 the membership was greatly reduced by the
withdrawal of a large number of the members and congregation in the organization
of the Park Avenue Congregational Church. In November of the
same year Edward P. Sprague became pastor. He was succeeded six years
later by Ken. C. Hayes, D. D., who is still in charge. Dr. Hayes is a native
of Butler County, and was educated at Waynesburg College. He served as
pastor at Middlesex five years before locating at Meadville. He is chaplain of
the Fifteenth Regiment, N. G. P., and as such served in the United States
service during the war with Spain.
The present membership of the church is about one hundred and fifty ;
and the Sunday School, which was first opened in 1814, and regularly organized
in 1819, contains about one hundred and thirty-five scholars. The
church disposes of a substantial fund for the use of the poor, donated by the
late Alanson Lindley, and named the "Alanson Lindley Fund for the Poor," of
which only the interest can be used.
<i>Central Presbyterian Church</i>.-A difference of opinion respecting doctrines
and church government culminated in the year 1838 in the division of
the Presbyterian sect into two branches, commonly known as the Old
School and New School. The division continued until 1869, when the two
bodies were happily reunited. This difference of opinion affected the Meadville
Church, the adherents of the New School going out to form a new organization
under the title of the Second Presbyterian Church. It was temporarily
ministered to by Revs. Lyon, Anderson, "Vest and Kellogg, until, in
June, 1841, Robinson S. Lockwood was called to the pastorate. In 1842
there was an extended revival, during which over fifty were added to the
membership. Mr. Lockwood was dismissed from the pastoral charge of the
