<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaths in Meadville from April 1880 through October 1920 were recorded in an oversize bound volume captioned on each sheet, &#147;Record of Physicians&#146; and Undertakers&#146; Returns of Deaths in the City of Meadville, Pennsylvania.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; The volume was formerly located at the Clerk&#146;s Office of City Hall, 984 Water Street, Meadville, and presumably moved to Diamond Park when City Hall relocated there. &nbsp; It apparently has not been filmed.&nbsp; Each sheet in the volume is lined and divided into nineteen columns, labelled as follows::
<blockquote>
NAME.&nbsp; COLOR.&nbsp; SEX.&nbsp; MARRIED or SINGLE.&nbsp; OCCUPATION.&nbsp; DATE of DEATH.&nbsp; CAUSE OF DEATH [subdivided into primary and secondary columns, but generally, only a single cause is given].&nbsp; [Attending] PHYSICIAN.&nbsp; NAME OF PARENTS.&nbsp; BIRTHPLACE OF DECEASED.&nbsp; AGE [subdivided into columns labelled y., m., d.].&nbsp; RESIDENCE [subdivided into no., street, ward].&nbsp; TIME OF RESIDENCE THEREIN [y., m., d.].&nbsp; PLACE OF PREVIOUS RESI DENCE.&nbsp; PLACE of INTERMENT.&nbsp; DATE of INTERMENT.&nbsp; UNDERTAKER OR INFORM ANT.&nbsp;  WATER USED.&nbsp;  No. OF REPORT.
</blockquote>
Data therein has been transcribed here verbatim except as noted. The original order has been maintained, except that the last column�the report number�is listed first. "Water used" (city or well) has been omitted. Capitalization of the decedent's color and marital status has been disregarded; and dates, names of states, "Township," "County," and the like have been uniformly abbreviated.
