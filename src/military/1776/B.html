<li><i>Meadville Courier</i> 18 July 1837, p. 3, col. 5: &#147;DIED&#151;On Thursday the 13th inst. at his residence in this borough, Mr. MOSES BALDWIN, a revolutionary soldier, in the 84th year of his age.&#151;The deceased was in the revolutionary army for three years. He was in the battle of Bunker Hill, and also in the attack upon Quebec when the lamented Montgomery fell. For the last twenty years of his life he was blind; and, as an old soldier, derived his support almost entirely from that which was in his circumstances, a &#145;scanty pittance&#146; afforded by government in the shape of a pension. The cause of his death was a cancer on his face, which first made its appearance six years ago.&#148;

[&#182;]The deceased was a native of Bucks county, Pa., and took an early part in the hazardous scenes of our revolutionary war. For three successive years he served in the capacity of soldier&#151;was in the ever memorable battle of Bunker&#146;s Hill, and several other subsequent engagements. We have not been able to trace minutely the different eventful changes of his life, but are informed that during the last 20 years he had been blind, 14 of which he has resided in this place, having removed here from the eastern part of the state, with his family. But a few, a very few, remain of his day.&#151;A little longer and they shall all be mingled with their kindred earth&#151;the sighing winds shall soon sweep over the <i>last</i> of the <i>patriots</i>.&#148;
